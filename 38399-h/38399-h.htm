<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>The Fourth Volume of <span class="smcap">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</span> is completed by the issue of the
present number. The Publishers embrace the opportunity of renewing the expression of their
thanks to the public and the press, for the extraordinary degree of favor with which its successive
Numbers have been received. Although it has but just reached the close of its second year, its
regular circulation is believed to be at least twice as great as that of any similar work ever issued in
any part of the world.</p>

<p>The Magazine will be continued in the same general style, and upon the same plan, as heretofore.
Its leading purpose is to furnish, at the lowest price, and in the best form, the greatest possible
amount of the useful and entertaining literary productions of the present age. While it is by no
means indifferent to the highest departments of culture, it seeks primarily to place before the great
masses of the people, in every section of the country, and in every walk of life, the most attractive
and instructive selections from the current literature of the day. No degree of labor or expense
will be spared upon any department. The most gifted and popular authors of the country write
constantly for its pages; the pictorial illustrations by which every Number is embellished are of the
best style, and by the most distinguished artists; the selections for its pages are made from the
widest range and with the greatest care; and nothing will be left undone, either in providing material,
or in its outward dress, which will tend in any degree to make it more worthy the remarkable favor
with which it has been received.</p>

<p>The Magazine will contain regularly as hitherto:</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;One or more original articles upon some topic of general interest, written by some popular
writer, and illustrated by from fifteen to thirty wood engravings, executed in the highest style
of art:</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Copious selections from the current periodical literature of the day, with tales of the
most distinguished authors, such as <span class="smcap">Dickens, Bulwer, Lever</span>, and others&mdash;chosen always for their
literary merit, popular interest, and general utility:</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;A Monthly Record of the events of the day, foreign and domestic, prepared with care,
and with entire freedom from prejudice and partiality of every kind:</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;Critical Notices of the Books of the day, written with ability, candor, and spirit, and
designed to give the public a clear and reliable estimate of the important works constantly issuing
from the press:</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i>&mdash;A Monthly Summary of European Intelligence concerning Books, Authors, and whatever
else has interest and importance for the cultivated reader:</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i>&mdash;An Editor's Table, in which some of the leading topics of the day will be discussed with
ability and independence:</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i>&mdash;An Editor's Easy Chair, or Drawer, which will be devoted to literary and general
gossip, memoranda of the topics talked about in social circles, graphic sketches of the most interesting
minor matters of the day, anecdotes of literary men, sentences of interest from papers not
worth reprinting at length, and generally an agreeable and entertaining collection of literary
miscellany.</p>

<p>The Publishers trust that it is not necessary for them to reiterate their assurances that nothing
shall ever be admitted to the pages of the Magazine in the slightest degree offensive to delicacy or
to any moral sentiment. They will seek steadily to exert upon the public a healthy moral influence,
and to improve the character, as well as please the taste, of their readers. They will aim
to make their Magazine the most complete repertory of whatever is both useful and agreeable in
the current literary productions of the day.</p>

<h3>BY BENSON J. LOSSING.</h3>


<p>Revolutions which dismember and overturn
empires, disrupt political systems, and
change not only the forms of civil government,
but frequently the entire character of society, are
often incited by causes so remote, and apparently
inconsiderable and inadequate, that the superficial
observer would never detect them, or would
laugh incredulously if presented to his consideration
as things of moment. Yet, like the little
spring of a watch, coiled unseen within the dark
recess of its chamber, the influences of such remote
causes operating upon certain combinations,
give motion, power, and value to latent energies,
and form the <i>primum mobile</i> of the whole machinery
of wonderful events which produce revolutions.</p>

<p>As a general rule, revolutions in states are the
results of isolated rebellions; and rebellions have
their birth in desires to cast off evils inflicted by
actual oppressions. These evils generally consist
of the interferences of rulers with the physical
well-being of the governed; and very few of the
political changes in empires which so prominently
mark the course of human history, have had a
higher incentive to resistance than the maintenance
of creature comforts. Abridgment of personal
liberty in the exercise of natural rights,
excessive taxation, and extortion of public officers,
whereby individual competence and consequent
ease have not been attainable, these have generally
been the chief counts in the indictment,
when the people have arisen in their might and
arraigned their rulers at the bar of the world's
judgment.</p>

<p>The American Revolution, which succeeded
local rebellions in the various provinces, was an
exception to a general rule. History furnishes
no parallel example of a people free, prosperous,
and happy, rising from the couch of ease to gird
on the panoply of war, with a certainty of encountering
perhaps years of privation and distress,
to combat the intangible <i>principle</i> of despotism.
The taxes of which the English colonies
in America complained, and which were the
ostensible cause of dissatisfaction, were almost
nominal, and only in the smallest degree affected
the general prosperity of the people. But the
method employed in levying those slight taxes,
and the prerogatives assumed by the king and
his ministers, plainly revealed the <i>principles</i> of
tyranny, and were the causes which produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the quarrel. In these assumptions the kernel of
despotism was very apparent, and the sagacious
Americans, accustomed to vigorous and independent
thought, and a free interchange of opinions,
foresaw the speedy springing of that germ into
the bulk and vigor of an umbrageous tree, that
would overshadow the land and bear the bitter
fruit of tyrannous misrule. Foreseeing this, they
resolved neither to water it kindly, nor generously
dig about its roots and open them to the genial
influences of the blessed sun and the dews; but,
on the contrary, to eradicate it. Tyranny had
no abiding-place in America when the quarrel
with the imperial government began, and the
War of the Revolution, in its inception and progress,
was eminently a war of principle.</p>

<p>How little could the wisest political seer have
perceived of an elemental cause of a revolution
in America, and the dismemberment of the British
Empire, in two pounds and two ounces of TEA,
which, a little less than two centuries ago, the
East India Company sent as a present to Charles
the Second of England! Little did the "merrie
monarch" think, while sitting with Nell Gwynn,
the Earl of Rochester, and a few other favorites,
in his private parlor at Whitehall, and that new
beverage gave pleasure to his sated taste, that
events connected with the use of the herb would
shake the throne of England, albeit a Guelph, a
wiser and more virtuous monarch than any Stuart,
should sit thereon. Yet it was even so; and TEA,
within a hundred years after that viceregal corporation
made its gift to royalty, became one of
the causes which led to rebellion and revolution,
resulting in the independence of the Anglo-American
colonies, and the founding of our
Republic.</p>

<p>When the first exuberant feelings of joy, which
filled the hearts of the Americans when intelligence
of the repeal of the Stamp Act reached
them, had subsided, and sober judgment analyzed
the Declaratory act of William Pitt which
accompanied the Repeal Bill, they perceived
small cause for congratulation. They knew Pitt
to be a friend&mdash;an earnest and sincere friend of
the colonists. He had labored shoulder to shoulder
with Barr&egrave;, Conway, Burke, and others, to
effect the repeal, and had recently declared boldly
in the House of Commons, "I rejoice that
America has resisted. Three millions of people,
so dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily
to submit to be slaves, would have been fit instruments
to make slaves of the rest." Yet he
saw hesitation; he saw <i>pride</i> standing in the
place of <i>righteousness</i>, and he allowed <i>expediency</i>
to usurp the place of <i>principle</i>, in order to accomplish
a great good. He introduced the Declaratory
Act, which was a sort of salvo to the national
honor, that a majority of votes might be
secured for the Repeal Bill. That act affirmed
that Parliament possessed the power <i>to bind the
colonies in all cases whatsoever</i>; clearly implying
the right to impose taxes to any extent, and in
any manner that ministers might think proper.
That temporizing measure was unworthy of the
great statesman, and had not the colonists possessed
too many proofs of his friendship to doubt
his constancy, they would now have placed him
in the category of the enemies of America. They
plainly perceived that no actual concession had
been made, and that the passage of the Repeal
Bill was only a truce in the systematic endeavors
of ministers to hold absolute control over the
Americans. The loud acclamations of joy and
the glad expressions of loyalty to the king,
which rung throughout America in the spring
and early summer of 1766, died away into low
whispers before autumn, and as winter approached,
and other schemes for taxation, such
as a new clause in the mutiny act developed,
were evolved from the ministerial laboratory,
loud murmurings went over the sea from every
English colony in the New World.</p>

<p>Much good was anticipated by the exercise of
the enlightened policy of the Rockingham ministry,
under whose auspices the Stamp Act had
been repealed, when it was suddenly dissolved,
and William Pitt, who was now elevated to the
peerage, became prime minister. Had not physical
infirmities borne heavily upon Lord Chatham,
all would have been well; but while he was tortured
by gout, and lay swathed in flannels at his
country-seat at Hayes, weaker heads controlled
the affairs of state. Charles Townshend, Pitt's
Chancellor of the Exchequer, a vain, truckling
statesman, coalesced with Grenville, the father
of the Stamp Act, in the production of another
scheme for deriving a revenue from America.
Too honest to be governed by expediency, Grenville
had already proposed levying a direct tax
upon the Americans of two millions of dollars
per annum, allowing them to raise that sum in
their own way. Townshend had the sagacity
to perceive that such a measure would meet
with no favor; but in May, 1767, he attempted
to accomplish the same result by introducing a
bill providing for the imposition of a duty upon
glass, paper, painters' colors, and <span class="smcap">tea</span> imported
from Great Britain into America. This was
only another form of taxation, and judicious men
in Parliament viewed the proposition with deep
concern. Burke and others denounced it in the
Commons; and Shelburne in the House of Lords
warned ministers to have a care how they proceeded
in the matter, for he clearly foresaw insurrection,
perhaps a revolution as a consequence.
But the voice of prudence, uttering words of
prophecy, was disregarded; Townshend's bill
was passed, and became a law at the close of
June, by receiving the royal signature. Other
acts, equally obnoxious to the Americans, soon
became laws by the sanction of the king, and the
principles of despotism, concealed behind the
honest-featured Declaratory Act, were displayed
in all their deformity.</p>

<p>During the summer and autumn, John Dickenson
sent forth his powerful <i>Letters of a Pennsylvania
Farmer</i>. Written in a simple manner,
they were easily understood. They laid bare the
evident designs of the ministry; proved the unconstitutionality
of the late acts of Parliament,
and taught the people the necessity of united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
resistance to the slow but certain approaches of
oppression.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 718px;">

<span class="caption">BOSTON IN 1770-74.</span>
</div>

<p>Boston, "the ringleader in rebellion," soon
took the initiative step in revolutionary movements,
and during 1768, tumults occurred, which
caused Governor Bernard to call for troops to awe
the people. General Thomas Gage, then commander-in-chief
of the British forces in America,
ordered two regiments from Halifax. Borne by
a fleet which blockaded the harbor in September,
they landed upon Long Wharf, in Boston, on
Sunday morning, and while the people were desirous
of worshiping quietly in their meeting-houses,
these soldiers marched to the Common
with charged muskets, fixed bayonets, drums
beating, and colors flying, with all the pomp and
insolence of victorious troops entering a vanquished
city. It was a great blunder, and Governor
Bernard soon perceived it.</p>

<p>A convention of delegates from every town
but one in Massachusetts was in session, when
the fleet arrived in Nantasket roads. They were
not alarmed by the approach of cannon and bayonets,
but deliberated coolly, and denounced
firmly the current measures of government.
Guided by their advice, the select-men of Boston
refused to furnish quarters for the troops, and
they were obliged to encamp on the open Common,
where insults were daily bandied between
the military hirelings and the people. The inhabitants
of Boston, and of the whole province
felt insulted&mdash;ay, degraded&mdash;and every feeling
of patriotism and manhood rebelled. The alternative
was plain before them&mdash;<i>submission or the
bayonet!</i></p>

<p>Great indignation prevailed from the Penobscot
to the St. Mary's, and the cause of Boston
became the common cause of all the colonists.
They resented the insult as if offered to themselves;
and hatred of royal rule became a fixed
emotion in the hearts of thousands. Legislative
assemblies spoke out freely, and for the crime
of being thus independent, royal governors dissolved
them. Delegates returned to their constituents,
each an eloquent crusader against oppression;
and in every village and hamlet men
congregated to consult upon the public good, and
to determine upon a remedy for the monster evil
now sitting like an incubus upon the peace and
prosperity of the land.</p>

<p>As a countervailing measure, merchants in the
various coast towns entered into an agreement to
cease importing from Great Britain, every thing
but a few articles of common necessity (and especially
those things enumerated in the impost
bill), from the first of January, 1769, to the first
of January, 1770, unless the obnoxious act should
be sooner repealed. The people every where seconded
this movement by earnest co-operation, and
Provincial legislatures commended the scheme.
An agreement, presented in the Virginia House
of Burgesses by Washington, was signed by every
member; and in all the colonies the people entered
at once upon a course of self-denial. For
more than a year this powerful engine of retaliation
waged war upon British commerce in a constitutional
way, before ministers would listen to
petitions and remonstrances; and it was not until
virtual rebellion in the British capital, born
of commercial distress, menaced the ministry,
that the expostulations of the Americans were
noticed, except with sneers.</p>

<p>In America meetings were frequently held, and
men thus encouraged each other by mutual conference.
Nor did <i>men</i>, alone, preach and practice
self-denial; American <i>women</i>, the wives and
daughters of patriots, cast their influence into the
scale of patriotism, and by cheering voices and
noble examples, became efficient co-workers.
And when, in Boston, cupidity overcame patriotism,
and the defection of a few merchants who
loved gold more than liberty, aroused the friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of the non-importation leagues, and assembled
them in general council in Faneuil Hall, there to
declare that they would "totally abstain from the
use of <span class="smcap">tea</span>," and other proscribed articles, the
women of that city, fired with zeal for the general
good, spoke out publicly and decidedly upon
the subject. Early in February, 1770, the mistresses
of three hundred families subscribed their
names to a league, binding themselves not to use
any more <span class="smcap">tea</span> until the impost clause in the Revenue
Act should be repealed. Their daughters
speedily followed their patriotic example, and
three days afterward, a multitude of young ladies
in Boston and vicinity, signed the following
pledge:</p>

<p>"We, the daughters of those patriots who have,
and do now appear for the public interest, and in
that principally regard their posterity&mdash;as such,
do with pleasure engage with them in denying
ourselves the drinking of foreign <span class="smcap">tea</span>, in hopes
to frustrate a plan which tends to deprive a whole
community of all that is valuable in life."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/illo_03.jpg" width="640" height="494" alt="FANEUIL HALL." title="" />
<span class="caption">FANEUIL HALL.</span>
</div>

<p>From that time, <span class="smcap">tea</span> was a proscribed article
in Boston, and opposition to the form of oppression
was strongly manifested by the unanimity
with which the pleasant beverage was discarded.
Nor did the ladies of Boston bear this honor
alone, but in Salem, Newport, Norwich, New
York, Philadelphia, Annapolis, Williamsburg,
Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah, the women
sipped "the balsamic hyperion," made from
the dried leaves of the raspberry plant, and discarded
"the poisonous bohea." The newspapers
of the day abound with notices of social gatherings
where foreign tea was entirely discarded.</p>

<p>About this time Lord North succeeded Townshend
as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was an
honest man, a statesman of good parts, and a sincere
friend to English liberty. He doubtless desired
to discharge his duty faithfully, yet in dealing
with the Americans, he utterly misunderstood
their character and temper, and could not
perceive the justice of their demands. This was
the minister who mismanaged the affairs of Great
Britain throughout the whole of our war for independence,
and by his pertinacity in attempts
to tax the colonies, and in opposing them in their
efforts to maintain their rights, he finally drove
them to rebellion, and protracted the war until
reconciliation was out of the question.</p>

<p>Early in 1770, the British merchants, the most
influential class in the realm, were driven by the
non-importation agreements to become the friends
of the colonists, and to join with them in petitions
and remonstrances. The London merchants
suffered more from the operations of the
new Revenue Laws, than the Americans. They
had early foreseen the consequences of an attempt
to tax the colonists; and when Townshend's
scheme was first proposed, they offered
to pay an equivalent sum into the Treasury,
rather than risk the loss of the rapidly-increasing
American trade. Now, that anticipated loss was
actual, and was bearing heavily upon them. It
also affected the national exchequer. In one
year, exports to America had decreased in amount
to the value of almost four millions of dollars;
and within three years (1767 to 1770), the government
revenue from America decreased from
five hundred and fifty thousand dollars per annum,
to one hundred and fifty thousand. These
facts awakened the people; these figures alarmed
the government; and early in March, Lord North
asked leave to bring in a bill, in the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Commons, for repealing the duties upon glass,
paper, and painters' colors, but retaining the
duty of three-pence upon <span class="smcap">tea</span>. This impost was
very small&mdash;avowedly a "pepper-corn rent," retained
to save the national honor, about which
ministers prated so loudly. The friends of America&mdash;the
<i>true</i> friends of English liberty and "national
honor"&mdash;asked for a repeal of the whole
act; the stubborn king, and the short-sighted
ministry would not consent to make the concession.
North's bill became a law in April, and he
fondly imagined that the insignificant three-pence
a pound, upon a single article of luxury, would
now be overlooked by the colonists. How egregiously
he misapprehended their character!</p>

<p>When intelligence of this act reached America,
the scheme found no admirers. The people had
never complained of the <i>amount</i> of the taxes levied
by impost; it was trifling. They asserted that
Great Britain had <i>no right to tax them at all</i>,
without their consent. It was for a great <i>principle</i>
they were contending; and they regarded
the retention of the duty of three-pence upon the
single article of <span class="smcap">tea</span>, as much a violation of the
constitutional rights of the colonists, as if there
had been laid an impost a hundred-fold greater,
upon a score of articles. This was the issue, and
no partial concessions would be considered.</p>

<p>The non-importation agreements began to be
disregarded by many merchants, and six months
before this repeal bill became a law, they had
agreed, in several places, to import every thing
but <span class="smcap">tea</span>, and that powerful lever of opposition
had now almost ceased to work. <span class="smcap">Tea</span> being an
article of luxury, the resolutions to discard that
were generally adhered to, and concerning <span class="smcap">tea</span>,
alone, the quarrel was continued.</p>

<p>For two years very little occurred to disturb
the tranquillity
of New England.
Thomas
Hutchinson,
a man of
fair abilities,
but possessed
of very little
prudence or
sound judgment,
succeeded
Bernard
as Governor
of Massachusetts.
New men,
zealous and
capable, were
coming forth
from among the people, to do battle for right and
freedom. Poor Otis, whose eloquent voice had often
stirred up the fires of rebellion in the hearts of
the Bostonians, when <i>Writs of Assistance</i>, and
the <i>Stamp Act</i>, elicited his denunciations, and
who, with prophetic voice, had told his brethren
in Great Britain, "Our fathers were a <i>good</i> people,
we have been a <i>free</i> people, and if you will
not let us be so any longer, we shall be a <i>great</i>
people," was now under a cloud. But his colleagues,
some of them very young, were growing
strong and experienced. John Adams, then six-and-thirty,
and rapidly rising in public estimation,
occupied the seat of Otis in the General Assembly.
John Hancock, one of the wealthiest
merchants of Boston; Samuel Adams, a Puritan
of great experience and tried integrity; Joseph
Warren, a young physician, full of energy and
hope, who afterward fell on Breed's Hill; Josiah
Quincy, a polished orator, though almost a stripling;
Thomas Cushing, James Warren, Dr. Samuel
Church, Robert Treat Paine&mdash;these became
the popular leaders, and fostered "the child independence,"
which John Adams said, was born
when Otis denounced the Writs of Assistance, and
the populace sympathized. These were the men
who, at private meetings, concerted plans for public
action; and with them, Hutchinson soon quarreled.
They issued a circular, declaring the rights
of the colonies, and enumerating their grievances.
Hutchinson denounced it as seditious and traitorous;
and while the public mind was excited
by the quarrel, Dr. Franklin, who was agent for
the colony in England, transmitted to the Speaker
of the Assembly several private letters, written by
the governor to members of Parliament, in which
he spoke disrespectfully of the Americans, and
recommended the adoption of coercive measures
to abridge "what are called English liberties."
These revelations raised a furious storm, and
the people were with difficulty restrained from
inflicting personal violence upon the governor.
All classes, from the men in legislative council
to the plainest citizen, felt a disgust that could
not be concealed, and a breach was opened between
ruler and people that grew wider every
day.</p>

<span class="caption">EARL OF DARTMOUTH.</span>
</div>

<p>The Earl of Hillsborough, who had been Secretary
of State for the Colonies during the past
few years of excitement, was now succeeded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Lord Dartmouth, a personal friend to Dr. Franklin,
a sagacious statesman, and a man sincerely
disposed to do justice to the colonies.
Had his councils prevailed, the duty
upon tea would have been taken off,
and all cause for discontent on the
part of the colonies, removed. But
North's blindness, countenanced by
ignorant or wicked advisers, prevailed
in the cabinet, and the olive-branch
of peace and reconciliation, constantly
held out by the Americans while declaring
their rights, was spurned.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1773, the East
India Company, feeling the effects of
the non-importation agreements and
the colonial contraband trade, opened
the way for reconciliation, while endeavoring
to benefit themselves. Already
seventeen millions of pounds
of tea had accumulated in their warehouses
in England, and the demand for it in
America was daily diminishing. To open anew
an extensive market so suddenly closed, the
Company offered to allow government to retain
six-pence upon the pound as an exportation tariff,
if they would take off the duty of three-pence.
Ministers had now a fair opportunity, not only to
conciliate the colonies in an honorable way, but
to procure, without expense, double the amount
of revenue. But the ministry, deluded by false
views of national honor, would not listen to the
proposition, but stupidly favored the East India
Company, while persisting in unrighteousness
toward the Americans. A bill was passed in
May, to allow the Company to export tea to
America on their own account, without paying
export duty, while the impost of three-pence was
continued. The mother country thus taught the
colonists to regard her as a voluntary oppressor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 418px;">
<img src="images/illo_06.jpg" width="418" height="311" alt="HANCOCK&#39;S HOUSE." title="" />
<span class="caption">HANCOCK&#39;S HOUSE.</span>
</div>

<p>While the bill for allowing the East India
Company to export tea to America on their own
account, was under consideration in Parliament,
Dr. Franklin, Arthur Lee, and others, apprised
the colonists of the movement; and when, a few
weeks afterward, several large vessels laden with
the plant, were out upon the Atlantic, bound for
American ports, the people here were actively
preparing to prevent the landing of the cargoes.
The Company had appointed consignees in various
seaport towns, and these being generally
known to the people, were warned to resign their
commissions, or hold them at their peril.</p>

<p>In Boston the most active measures were taken
to prevent the landing of the tea. The consignees
were all friends of government; two
of them were Governor Hutchinson's sons, and
a third (Richard Clarke, father-in-law of John
Singleton Copley, the eminent painter), was
his nephew. Their neighbors expostulated with
them, but in vain; and as the time for the expected
arrival of two or three tea-ships approached,
the public mind became feverish. On the
first of November several of the leading "Sons
of Liberty," as the patriots were called, met at
the house of John Hancock, on Beacon-street,
facing the Common, to consult upon the public
good, touching the expected tea ships. A public
meeting was decided upon, and on the morning
of the third the following placard was posted in
many places within the city:</p>

<blockquote><p>"TO THE FREEMEN OF THIS AND THE NEIGHBORING TOWNS.</p>

<p>"<i>Gentlemen.</i>&mdash;You are desired to meet at the
Liberty Tree this day at twelve o'clock at noon,
then and there to hear the persons to whom the
<span class="smcap">Tea</span> shipped by the East India Company is consigned,
make a public resignation of their offices
as consignees, upon oath; and also swear that
they will reship any teas that may be consigned
to them by the said Company, by the first vessel
sailing to London.</p>

<p>
O. C. Sec'y.<br />
</p>

<p>"Boston, Nov. 3, 1773.</p>

<p>"<img src="images/illo_06a.jpg" alt="A pointing finger" width="32" height="16" />
Show me the man that dare take this
down!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The consignees were summoned at an early
hour in the morning, to appear under Liberty
Tree (a huge elm, which stood at the present
junction of Washington and Essex streets), and
resign their commissions. They treated the
summons with contempt, and refused to comply.
At the appointed hour the town-crier proclaimed
the meeting, and the church-bells of the city
also gave the annunciation. Timid men remained
at home, but about five hundred people assembled
near the tree, from the top of which floated
the New England flag. No definite action was
taken, and at three o'clock the meeting had dispersed.</p>

<p>On the 5th, another meeting was held, over
which John Hancock presided. Several short but
vehement speeches were made, in which were
uttered many seditious sentiments; eight resistance
resolutions adopted by the Philadelphians
were agreed too; and a committee was appointed
to wait upon the consignees, who, it was known,
were then at Clarke's store, on King-street,
and request them to resign. Again those gentlemen
refused compliance, and when the committee
reported to the meeting, it was voted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the answer of the consignees was "unsatisfactory
and highly affrontive." This meeting also
adjourned without deciding upon any definite
course for future action.</p>

<p>The excitement in Boston now hourly increased.
Grave citizens congregated at the corners
of the streets to interchange sentiments,
and all seemed to have a presentiment that the
sanguinary scenes of the 5th of March, 1770,
when blood flowed in the streets of Boston, were
about to be reproduced.</p>

<p>The troops introduced by Bernard had been
removed from the city, and there was no legal
power but that of the civil authorities, to suppress
disorder. On the 12th, the captain-general
of the province issued an order for the Governor's
Guards, of which John Hancock was colonel, to
stand in readiness to assist the civil magistrate
in preserving order. This corps, being strongly
imbued with the sentiments of their commander,
utterly disregarded the requisition. Business
was, in a measure, suspended, and general uneasiness
prevailed.</p>

<span class="caption">PROVINCE HOUSE.</span>
</div>

<p>On the 18th, another meeting was held in
Faneuil Hall, and a committee was again appointed
to wait upon the consignees and request
them to resign. Again they refused, and that
evening the house of Richard Clarke, on School-street,
was surrounded by an unruly crowd. A
pistol was fired from the house, but without
serious effect other than exciting the mob to
deeds of violence; the windows were demolished,
and the family menaced with personal injury.
Better counsels than those of anger soon prevailed,
and at midnight the town was quiet.
The meeting, in the mean while, had received the
report of the committee in silence, and adjourned
without uttering a word. This silence was ominous
of evil to the friends of government. The
consignees were alarmed, for it was evident that
the people were determined to <i>talk</i> only, no more,
but henceforth to <i>act</i>. The governor, also, properly
interpreted their silence as a calm before a
storm, and he called his council together at the
Province House, to consult upon measures for
preserving the peace of the city. During their
session the frightened consignees presented a
petition to the council, asking leave to resign
their commissions into the hands of the governor
and his advisers, and praying them to adopt
measures for the safe landing of the teas. The
council, equally fearful of the popular vengeance,
refused the prayer of their petition, and the consignees
withdrew, for safety, to Castle William,
a strong fortress at the entrance of the harbor,
then garrisoned by a portion of the troops who
had been encamped on Boston Common. The
flight of the consignees allayed the excitement
for a few days.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening, the 28th of November,
the <i>Dartmouth</i>, Captain Hall, one of the East
India Company's ships, arrived in the harbor.
The next morning the following handbill was
posted in every part of the city:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Friends! Brethren! Countrymen!</i>&mdash;That
worst of plagues, the detested <span class="smcap">Tea</span> shipped for
this port, by the East India Company, is now
arrived in the harbor. The hour of destruction,
or manly opposition to the machinations of tyranny,
stares you in the face; every friend to his
country, to himself, and to posterity, is now called

</div>

<p>A large concourse assembled in and around
Faneuil Hall at the appointed hour, too large to
be admitted within its walls, and
they adjourned to the Old South
Meeting House, on the corner of
the present Washington and Milk
streets. Hancock, the Adamses,
Warren, Quincy, and other
popular leaders and influential
citizens were there. Firmness
marked all the proceedings, and
within that sanctuary of religion
they made resolves of gravest
import. It was agreed that
no <span class="smcap">tea</span>
should
be landed
within
the
precincts
of
Boston;
that no
duty
should
be paid;
and that
it should
be sent back in the same bottom. They also
voted that Mr. Roch, the owner of the <i>Dartmouth</i>,
"be directed not to enter the tea at his peril;
and that Captain Hall be informed, and at his
peril, not to suffer any of the tea to be landed."
They ordered the ship to be moored at Griffin's
wharf, near the present Liverpool dock, and appointed
a guard of twenty-five men to watch her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>When the meeting was about to adjourn, a
letter was received from the consignees, offering
to store the tea until they could write to England
and obtain instructions from the owners. The
people had resolved that not a chest should be
landed, and the offer was at once rejected. The
sheriff, who was present, then stepped upon
the back of a pew, and read a proclamation
by the governor, ordering the assembly to disperse.
It was received with hisses. Another
resolution was then adopted, ordering two other
tea vessels, then hourly expected, to be moored
at Griffin's wharf; and, after solemnly pledging
themselves to carry their several resolutions into
effect at all hazards, and thanking the people in
attendance from the neighboring towns for their
sympathy, they adjourned.</p>

<p>Every thing relating to the <span class="smcap">tea</span> movement was
now in the hands of the Boston Committee of
Correspondence. A large volunteer guard was
enrolled, and every necessary preparation was
made to support the resistance resolutions of
the 29th. A fortnight elapsed without any special
public occurrence, when, on the afternoon of
the 13th of December, intelligence went through
the town that the <i>Eleanor</i>, Captain James Bruce,
and the <i>Beaver</i>, Captain Hezekiah Coffin, ships
of the East India Company, laden with tea, had
entered the harbor. They were moored at Griffin's
wharf by the volunteer guard, and that night
there were many sleepless eyes in Boston. The
Sons of Liberty convened at an early hour in the
evening, and expresses were sent to the neighboring
towns with the intelligence. Early the
next morning the following placard appeared:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Friends! Brethren! Countrymen!</i>&mdash;The perfidious
arts of your restless enemies to render
ineffectual the resolutions of the body of the
people, demand your assembling at the Old South
Meeting House precisely at two o'clock this day,
at which time the bells will ring."</p></blockquote>

<p>The "Old South" was crowded at the appointed
hour, yet perfect order prevailed. It was resolved
to order Mr. Roch to apply immediately for a
clearance for his ship, and send her to sea. The
owner was in a dilemma, for the governor had
taken measures, since the arrival of the Dartmouth,
to prevent her sailing out of the harbor.
Admiral Montague, who happened to be in Boston,
was directed to fit out two armed vessels,
and station them at the entrance to the harbor, to
act in concert with Colonel Leslie, the commander
of the garrison at the Castle. Leslie had already
received written orders from the governor not to
allow any vessel to pass the guns of the fort, outward,
without a permit, signed by himself. Of
course Mr. Roch could do nothing.</p>

<p>As no effort had yet been made to land the
tea, the meeting adjourned, to assemble again on
the 16th, at the same place. These several
popular assemblies attracted great attention in
the other colonies; and from New York and
Philadelphia in particular, letters, expressive of
the strongest sympathy and encouragement, were
received by the Committee of Correspondence.
At the appointed hour on the 16th, the "Old
South" was again crowded, and the streets near
were filled with a multitude, eager to participate
in the proceedings. They had flocked in from
the neighboring towns by hundreds. So great
a gathering of people had never before occurred
in Boston. Samuel Phillips Savage, of Weston,
was chosen Moderator, or Chairman, and around
him sat many men who, two years afterward,
were the recognized leaders of the Revolution in
Massachusetts. When the preliminary business
was closed, and the meeting was about to appoint
committees for more vigorous action than had
hitherto been directed, the youthful Josiah Quincy
arose, and with words almost of prophecy,
uttered with impassioned cadence, he harangued
the multitude. "It is not, Mr. Moderator," he
said, "the spirit that vapors within these walls
that must stand us in stead. The exertions of
this day will call forth events which will make a
very different spirit necessary for our salvation.
Whoever supposes that shouts and hosannas will
terminate the trials of this day, entertains a childish
fancy. We must be grossly ignorant of the
importance and the value of the prize for which
we contend: we must be equally ignorant of the
power of those who have combined against us;
we must be blind to that malice, inveteracy, and
insatiable revenge, which actuates our enemies,
public and private, abroad and in our bosoms, to
hope that we shall end this controversy without
the sharpest conflicts&mdash;to flatter ourselves
that popular resolves, popular harangues, popular
acclamations, and popular vapor will vanquish
our foes. Let us consider the issue. Let
us look to the end. Let us weigh and consider
before we advance to those measures which must
bring on the most trying and terrible struggle this
country ever saw." This gifted young patriot did
not live to see the struggle he so confidently anticipated;
for, when blood was flowing, in the
first conflicts at Lexington and Concord, eighteen
month's afterward, he was dying with consumption,
on ship-board, almost within sight of his
native land.</p>

<p>The people, in the "Old South," were greatly
agitated when Quincy closed his harangue. It
was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon.
The question was immediately proposed
to the meeting, "Will you abide by your former
resolutions with respect to not suffering the <span class="smcap">tea</span>
to be landed?" The vast assembly within, as
with one voice, replied affirmatively, and when
the purport was known without, the multitude
there responded in accordance. The meeting
now awaited the return of Mr. Roch, who had
been to the governor to request a permit for his
vessel to leave the harbor. Hutchinson, alarmed
at the stormy aspect of affairs, had taken counsel
of his fears, and withdrawn from the city to his
country-house at Milton, a few miles from Boston.
It was sunset when Roch returned and informed
the meeting that the governor refused to grant a
permit, until a clearance should be exhibited. As
a clearance had already been refused by the collector
of the port, until the cargo should be landed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
it was evident that government officers had concerted
to resist the demands of the people. Like
a sea lashed by a storm, that meeting swayed
with excitement, and eagerly demanded from the
leaders some indication for immediate action.
Night was fast approaching, and as the twilight
deepened, a call was made for candles. At that
moment, a person in the gallery, disguised in the
garb of a Mohawk Indian, gave a war-whoop,
which was answered from without. That signal,
like the notes of a trumpet before the battle-charge,
fired the assemblage, and as another voice
in the gallery shouted, "Boston harbor a tea-pot
to-night! Hurrah for Griffin's wharf!" a motion
to adjourn was carried, and the multitude rushed
to the street. "To Griffin's wharf! to Griffin's
wharf!" again shouted several voices, while a
dozen men, disguised as Indians, were seen
speeding over Fort Hill, in that direction. The
populace followed, and in a few minutes the scene
of excitement was transferred from the "Old
South" to the water side.</p>

<p>No doubt the vigilant patriots had arranged
this movement, in anticipation of the refusal of
the governor to allow the <i>Dartmouth</i> to depart;
for concert of action marked all the operations at
the wharf. The number of persons disguised
as Indians, was fifteen or twenty,
and these, with others who joined them,
appeared to recognize Lendall Pitts, a mechanic
of Boston, as their leader. Under
his directions, about sixty persons boarded
the three tea-ships, brought the chests upon
deck, broke them open, and cast their contents
into the water. The <i>Dartmouth</i> was
boarded first; the <i>Eleanor</i> and <i>Beaver</i> were
next entered; and within the space of two
hours, the contents of three hundred and
forty-two chests of tea were cast into the
waters of the harbor. During the occurrence
very little excitement was manifested
among the multitude upon the wharf; and
as soon as the work of destruction was
completed, the active party marched in
perfect order back into the town, preceded
by a drum and fife, dispersed to their
homes, and Boston, untarnished by actual
mob or riot, was never more tranquil than
on that bright and frosty December night.</p>

</div>

<p>A British squadron was not more than
a quarter of a mile from Griffin's wharf,
where this event occurred, and British
troops were near, yet the whole proceeding
was uninterrupted. The newspapers
of the day doubtless gave the correct interpretation
to this apathy. Something far
more serious had been anticipated, if an attempt
should be made to land the tea; and
the owners of the vessels, as well as the
public authorities, civil and military, doubtless
thanked the <i>rioters</i>, in their secret thoughts, for
thus extricating them from a serious dilemma.
They would doubtless have been worsted in an
attempt forcibly to land the tea; now, the vessels
were saved from destruction; no blood was spilt;
the courage of the civil and military officers remained
unimpeached; the "<i>national honor</i>" was
not compromised, and the Bostonians, having
carried their resolutions into effect, were satisfied.
The East India Company alone, which was the
actual loser, had cause for complaint.</p>

<p>It may be asked, Who were the men actively
engaged in this high-handed measure? Were
they an ignorant rabble, with no higher motives
than the gratification of a mobocratic spirit? By
no means. While some of them were doubtless
governed, in a measure, by such a motive, the
greater portion were young men and lads who
belonged to the respectable part of the community,
and of the fifty-nine participators whose
names have been preserved, some of them held
honorable stations in after life; some battled
nobly in defense of liberty in the Continental
Army of the Revolution which speedily followed,
and almost all of them, according to traditionary
testimony, were entitled to the respect due to
good citizens. Only one, of all that band, as
far as is known, is yet among the living, and he
has survived almost a half century beyond the
allotted period of human life. When the present
century dawned, he had almost reached the goal
of three score and ten years; and now, at the age
of <i>one hundred and fifteen years</i>, <span class="smcap">David Kinnison</span>,
of Chicago, Illinois, holds the eminent position
of the <i>last survivor of the Boston Tea Party</i>!
When the writer, in 1848, procured the portrait
and autograph of the aged patriot, he was living
among strangers and ignorant of the earthly existence
of one of all his twenty-two children. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
daughter survives, and having been made acquainted
of the existence of her father, by the
publication of this portrait in the "Field-Book,"
she hastened to him, and is now smoothing the
pillow of the patriarch as he is gradually passing
into the long and peaceful slumber of the grave.</p>

<p>The life of another actor was spared, until
within ten years, and his portrait, also, is preserved.
<span class="smcap">George Robert Twelves Hewes</span>,
was supposed to be the latest survivor, until
the name of David Kinnison was made public.
Soon not one of all that party will be among
the living.</p>

<p>Before closing this article let us advert to the
<i>effect</i> produced by the destruction of the tea in
Boston Harbor, for to effects alone are causes
indebted for importance.</p>

<p>The events of the 16th of December produced
a deep sensation throughout the British realm.
They struck a sympathetic chord in every colony
which afterward rebeled; and even Canada, Halifax,
and the West Indies, had no serious voice of
censure for the Bostonians. But the ministerial
party here, and the public in England, amazed
at the audacity of the Americans in opposing
royal authority, and in destroying private property,
called loudly for punishment; and even
the friends of the colonists in Parliament were,
for a moment, silent, for they could not fully
excuse the lawless act. Another and a powerful
party was now made a principal in the quarrel;
the East India Company whose property
had been destroyed, was now directly interested
in the question of taxation. That huge monopoly
which had controlled the commerce of the
Indies for more than a century and a half, was
then almost at the zenith of its power. Already
it had laid the foundation, broad and deep, of
that British-Indian Empire which now comprises
the whole of Hindostan, from the Himalaya
Mountains to Cape Comorin, with a population
of more than one hundred and twenty millions,
and its power in the government affairs of Great
Britain, was almost vice-regal. Unawed by the
fleets and armies of the imperial government, and
by the wealth and power of this corporation, the
Bostonians justified their acts by the rules of
justice and the guarantees of the British constitution;
and the next vessel to England, after
the event was known there, carried out an honest
proposition to the East India Company, from
the people of Boston, to pay for the tea destroyed.
The whole matter rested at once upon its original
basis&mdash;the right of Great Britain to tax the
colonies&mdash;and this fair proposition of the Bostonians
disarmed ministers of half their weapons
of vituperation. The American party in England
saw nothing whereof to be ashamed, and the
presses, opposed to the ministry, teemed with
grave disquisitions, satires, and lampoons, all favorable
to the colonists, while art lent its aid in
the production of several caricatures similar to
the one here given, in which Lord North is represented
as pouring tea down the throat of unwilling
America, who is held fast by Lord Mansfield
(then employed by government in drawing up
the various acts so obnoxious to the colonists),
while Britannia stands by, weeping at the distress
of her daughter. In America, almost every
newspaper of the few printed, was filled with arguments,
epigrams, parables, sonnets, dialogues,
and every form of expression favorable to the
resistance made in Boston to the arbitrary acts
of government; and a voice of approval went
forth from pulpits, courts of law, and the provincial
legislatures.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/illo_11.jpg" width="335" height="266" alt="Pouring tea down the throat of America" title="" />
</div>

<p>Great was the exasperation of the king and
his ministers when intelligence of the proceedings
in Boston reached them. According to
Burke, the "House of Lords was like a seething
caldron"&mdash;the House of Commons was "as hot
as Faneuil Hall or the Old South Meeting House
at Boston." Ministers and their supporters charged
the colonies with open rebellion, while the
opposition denounced, in the strongest language
which common courtesy would allow, the foolish,
unjust, and wicked course of government.</p>

<p>In cabinet council, the king and his ministers
deliberately considered the matter, and the result
was a determination to use coercive measures
against the colonies. The first of these schemes
was a bill brought forward in March, 1774, which
provided for the closing of the port of Boston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and the removal of customs, courts of justice,
and government offices of every kind from Boston
to Salem. This was avowedly a retaliatory
measure; and the famous <i>Boston Port Bill</i>,
which, more than any other act of the British
government, was instrumental in driving the
colonies to rebellion, became a law within a hundred
days after the destruction of the tea. In
the debate upon this bill, the most violent language
was used toward the Americans. Lord
North justified the measure by asserting that
Boston was "the centre of rebellious commotion
in America; the ring-leader in every riot." Mr.
Herbert declared that the Americans deserved no
consideration; that they were "never actuated
by decency or reason, and that they always
chose tarring and feathering as an argument;"
while Mr. Van, another ministerial supporter,
denounced the people of Boston as totally unworthy of
civilized forbearance&mdash;declared that "they
ought to have their town knocked about their
ears, and destroyed;" and concluded his tirade
of abuse by quoting the factious cry of the old
Roman orators, "Delenda est Carthago!"&mdash;Carthage
must be destroyed.</p>

<p>Edmund Burke, who now commenced his
series of splendid orations in favor of America,
denounced the whole scheme as essentially wicked
and unjust, because it punished the innocent
with the guilty. "You will thus irrevocably
alienate the hearts of the colonies from the mother
country," he exclaimed. "The bill is unjust,
since it bears only upon the city of Boston, while
it is notorious that all America is in flames; that
the cities of Philadelphia, of New York, and all
the maritime towns of the continent, have exhibited
the same disobedience. You are contending
for a matter which the Bostonians will
not give up quietly. They can not, by such
means, be made to bow to the authority of ministers;
on the contrary, you will find their obstinacy
confirmed and their fury exasperated.
The acts of resistance in their city have not been
confined to the populace alone, but men of the
first rank and opulent fortune in the place have
openly countenanced them. One city in proscription
and the rest in rebellion, can never be
a remedial measure for disturbances. Have you
considered whether you have troops and ships
sufficient to reduce the people of the whole
American continent to your devotion?" From
denunciation he passed to appeal, and besought
ministers to pause ere they should strike a blow
that would forever separate the colonies from
Great Britain. But the pleadings of Burke and
others, were in vain, and "deaf to the voice of justice
and of consanguinity," this, and other rigorous
measures, were put in operation by ministers.</p>

<p>The industry and enterprise of Boston was
crushed when, on the first of June, the <i>Port Bill</i>
went into operation; but her voice of wail, as it
went over the land, awakened the noblest expressions
and acts of sympathy, and the blow
inflicted upon her was resented by all the colonies.
They all felt that forbearance was no
longer a virtue. Ten years they had pleaded,
petitioned, remonstrated; they were uniformly
answered by insult. There seemed no other alternative
but abject submission, or open, armed
resistance. They chose the latter, and thirteen
months after the Boston <i>Port Bill</i> became a law,
the battle at Lexington and Concord had been
fought, and Boston was beleaguered by an army
of patriots. The Battle of Bunker Hill soon
followed; a continental army was organized with
Washington at its head, and the war of the
Revolution began. Eight long years it continued,
when the oppressors, exhausted, gave up the
contest. Peace came, and with it, <span class="smcap">Independence</span>;
and the Republic of the United States
took its place among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>How conspicuous the feeble Chinese plant
should appear among these important events let
the voice of history determine.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN ARCTIC EXPEDITION.</h2>


<p>The safe return of the Expedition sent out
by Mr. Henry Grinnell, an opulent merchant
of New York city, in search of Sir John Franklin
and his companions, is an event of much
interest; and the voyage, though not resulting
in the discovery of the long-absent mariners,
presents many considerations satisfactory to the
parties immediately concerned, and to the American
public in general.</p>

<p>In the second volume of the Magazine, on
pages 588 to 597 inclusive, we printed some interesting
extracts from the journal of Mr. W.
<span class="smcap">Parker Snow</span>, of the <i>Prince Albert</i>, a vessel which
sailed from Aberdeen with a crew of Scotchmen,
upon the same errand of mercy. That account
is illustrated by engravings; and in his narrative,
Mr. Snow makes favorable mention of Mr. Grinnell's
enterprise, and the character of the officers,
crew, and vessels. We now present a more detailed
account of the American Expedition, its
adventures and results, together with several
graphic illustrations, engraved from drawings
made in the polar seas during the voyage, by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Berry</span>, a seaman of the <i>Advance</i>,
the largest of the two vessels. These drawings,
though made with a pencil in hands covered
with thick mittens, while the thermometer indicated
from 20&deg; to 40&deg; below zero, exhibit much
artistic skill in correctness of outline and beauty
of finish. Mr. Berry is a native of Hamburg,
Germany, and was properly educated for the
duties of the counting-room and the accomplishments
of social life. Attracted by the romance of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sea, the sea, the deep blue sea,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he abandoned home for the perilous and exciting
life of a sailor. Although only thirty years of
age, he has been fifteen years upon the ocean.
Five years he was in the English service, much
of the time in the waters near the Arctic Circle;
the remainder has been spent in the service of
the United States. He was with the <i>Germantown</i>
in the Gulf, during the war with Mexico,
and accompanied her marines at the siege of
Vera Cruz. He was in the <i>North Carolina</i> when
Lieutenant De Haven went on board seeking
volunteers for the Arctic Expedition. He offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
his services; they were accepted, and a more
skillful and faithful seaman never went aloft.
And it is pleasant to hear with what enthusiasm
he speaks of Commander De Haven, as a skillful
navigator and kind-hearted man. "He was as
kind to me as a brother," he said, "and I would
go with him to the ends of the earth, if he wanted
me." Although he speaks English somewhat
imperfectly, yet we have listened with great pleasure
to his intelligent narrative of the perils, occupations,
sports, and duties of the voyage. Since
his return he has met an uncle, the commander
of a merchant vessel, and, for the first time in
fifteen years, he received intelligence from his
family. "My mother is dead," said he to us,
while the tears gushed involuntarily from his
eyes; "I have no one to go home to now&mdash;I
shall stay here."</p>

<span class="caption">ADVANCE AND RESCUE BEATING TO WINDWARD OF AN ICEBERG THREE MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE.</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Grinnell's Expedition consisted of only
two small brigs, the <i>Advance</i> of 140 tons; the
<i>Rescue</i> of only 90 tons. The former had been
engaged in the Havana trade; the latter was a
new vessel, built for the merchant service. Both
were strengthened for the Arctic voyage at a
heavy cost. They were then placed under the
directions of our Navy board, and subject to naval
regulations as if in permanent service. The
command was given to Lieutenant E. De Haven,
a young naval officer who accompanied the United
States Exploring Expedition. The result has
proved that a better choice could not have been
made. His officers consisted of Mr. Murdoch,
sailing-master; Dr. E. K. Kane, Surgeon and
Naturalist; and Mr. Lovell, midshipman. The
<i>Advance</i> had a crew of twelve men when she
sailed; two of them complaining of sickness,
and expressing a desire to return home, were
left at the Danish settlement at Disko Island,
on the coast of Greenland.</p>

<p>The Expedition left New York on the 23d
of May, 1850, and was absent a little more than
sixteen months. They passed the eastern extremity
of Newfoundland ten days after leaving
Sandy Hook, and then sailed east-northeast,
directly for Cape Comfort, on the coast of Greenland.
The weather was generally fine, and only
a single accident occurred on the voyage to that
country of frost and snow. Off the coast of
Labrador, they met an iceberg making its way
toward the tropics. The night was very dark,
and as the huge voyager had no "light out" the
<i>Advance</i> could not be censured for running foul.
She was punished, however, by the loss of her
jib-boom, as she ran against the iceberg at the
rate of seven or eight knots an hour.</p>

<p>The voyagers did not land at Cape Comfort,
but turning northward, sailed along the southwest
coast of Greenland, sometimes in an open
sea, and sometimes in the midst of broad acres
of broken ice (particularly in Davis's Straits), as
far as Whale Island. On the way the anniversary
of our national independence occurred;
it was observed by the seamen by "splicing the
main-brace"&mdash;in other words, they were allowed
an extra glass of grog on that day.</p>

<p>From Whale Island, a boat, with two officers
and four seamen, was sent to Disko Island, a distance
of about 26 miles, to a Danish settlement
there, to procure skin clothing and other articles
necessary for use during the rigors of a Polar
winter. The officers were entertained at the
government house; the seamen were comfortably
lodged with the Esquimaux, sleeping in fur bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
at night. They returned to the ship the following
day, and the Expedition proceeded on its voyage.
When passing the little Danish settlement
of Upernavick, they were boarded by natives for
the first time. They were out in government
whale-boats, hunting for ducks and seals. These
hardy children of the Arctic Circle were not shy,
for through the Danes, the English whalers, and
government expeditions, they had become acquainted
with men of other latitudes.</p>

<span class="caption">PERILOUS SITUATION OF THE ADVANCE AND RESCUE IN MELVILLE BAY.</span>
</div>

<p>When the Expedition reached Melville Bay,
which, on account of its fearful character, is also
called the <i>Devil's Nip</i>, the voyagers began to
witness more of the grandeur and perils of Arctic
scenes. Icebergs of all dimensions came bearing
down from the Polar seas like vast squadrons,
and the roar of their rending came over the waters
like the booming of the heavy broadsides of
contending navies. They also encountered immense
<i>floes</i>, with only narrow channels between,
and at times their situation was exceedingly perilous.
On one occasion, after heaving through
fields of ice for five consecutive weeks, two immense
<i>floes</i>, between which they were making
their way, gradually approached each other, and
for several hours they expected their tiny vessels&mdash;tiny
when compared with the mighty objects
around them&mdash;would be crushed. An immense
<i>calf</i> of ice six or eight feet thick slid under
the <i>Rescue</i>, lifting her almost "high and dry,"
and careening her partially upon her beam's end.
By means of ice-anchors (large iron hooks),
they kept her from capsizing. In this position
they remained about sixty hours, when, with
saws and axes, they succeeded in relieving her.
The ice now opened a little, and they finally
warped through into clear water. While they
were thus confined, polar bears came around
them in abundance, greedy for prey, and the
seamen indulged a little in the perilous sports of
the chase.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ADVANCE, RESCUE, AND PRINCE ALBERT NEAR THE DEVIL&#39;S THUMB.</span>
</div>

<p>The open sea continued but a short time, when
they again became entangled among <i>bergs</i>, <i>floes</i>, and
<i>hummocks</i>, and encountered the most fearful
perils. Sometimes they anchored their vessels
to icebergs, and sometimes to <i>floes</i> or masses
of <i>hummock</i>. On one of these occasions, while
the cook, an active Frenchman, was upon a <i>berg</i>,
making a place for an anchor, the mass of ice
split beneath him, and he was dropped through
the yawning fissure into the water, a distance of
almost thirty feet. Fortunately the masses, as is
often the case, did not close up again, but floated
apart, and the poor cook was hauled on board
more dead than alive, from excessive fright. It
was in this fearful region that they first encountered
<i>pack-ice</i>, and there they were locked
in from the 7th to the 23d of July. During that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
time they were joined by the yacht <i>Prince Albert</i>,
commanded by Captain Forsyth, of the Royal
Navy, and together the three vessels were anchored,
for a while, to an immense field of ice,
in sight of the <i>Devil's Thumb</i>. That high, rocky
peak, situated in latitude 74&deg; 22' was about thirty
miles distant, and with the dark hills adjacent,
presented a strange aspect where all was white
and glittering. The peak and the hills are masses
of rock, with occasionally a lichen or a moss
growing upon their otherwise naked surfaces.
In the midst of the vast ice-field loomed up many
lofty <i>bergs</i>, all of them in motion&mdash;slow and
majestic motion.</p>

<p>From the <i>Devil's Thumb</i> the American vessels
passed onward through the <i>pack</i> toward Sabine's
Islands, while the <i>Prince Albert</i> essayed to make
a more westerly course. They reached Cape
York at the beginning of August. Far across
the ice, landward, they discovered, through their
glasses, several men, apparently making signals;
and for a while they rejoiced in the belief that
they saw a portion of Sir John Franklin's companions.
Four men (among whom was our
sailor-artist) were dispatched with a whale-boat
to reconnoitre. They soon discovered the men
to be Esquimaux, who, by signs, professed great
friendship, and endeavored to get the voyagers
to accompany them to their homes beyond the
hills. They declined: and as soon as they returned
to the vessel, the expedition again pushed
forward, and made its way to Cape Dudley
Digges, which they reached on the 7th of August.</p>

<p>At Cape Dudley Digges they were charmed by
the sight of the <i>Crimson Cliffs</i>, spoken of by Captain
Parry and other Arctic navigators. These
are lofty cliffs of dark brown stone, covered with
snow of a rich crimson color. It was a magnificent
sight in that cold region, to see such an
apparently warm object standing out in bold relief
against the dark blue back-ground of a polar
sky. This was the most northern point to which
the expedition penetrated. The whole coast
which they had passed from Disko to this cape
is high, rugged, and barren, only some of the low
points, stretching into the sea, bearing a species
of dwarf fir. Northeast from the cape rise the
Arctic Highlands, to an unknown altitude; and
stretching away northward is the unexplored
Smith's Sound, filled with impenetrable ice.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ADVANCE LEADING THE PRINCE ALBERT, NEAR LEOPOLD ISLAND.</span>
</div>

<p>From Cape Dudley Digges, the <i>Advance</i> and
<i>Rescue</i>, beating against wind and tide in the
midst of the ice-fields, made Wolstenholme
Sound, and then changing their course to the
southwest, emerged from the fields into the open
waters of Lancaster Sound. Here, on the 18th
of August, they encountered a tremendous gale,
which lasted about twenty-four hours. The two
vessels parted company during the storm, and
remained separate several days. Across Lancaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Sound, the <i>Advance</i> made her way to Barrow's
Straits, and on the 22d discovered the
<i>Prince Albert</i> on the southern shore of the straits,
near Leopold Island, a mass of lofty, precipitous
rocks, dark and barren, and hooded and draped
with snow. The weather was fine, and soon
the officers and crews of the two vessels met in
friendly greeting. Those of the <i>Prince Albert</i>
were much astonished, for they (being towed by
a steamer) left the Americans in Melville Bay on
the 6th, pressing northward through the <i>pack</i>, and
could not conceive how they so soon and safely
penetrated it. Captain Forsyth had attempted
to reach a particular point, where he intended to
remain through the winter, but finding the passage
thereto completely blocked up with ice, he
had resolved, on the very day when the Americans
appeared, to "'bout ship," and return home.
This fact, and the disappointment felt by Mr.
Snow, are mentioned in our former article.</p>

<p>The two vessels remained together a day or
two, when they parted company, the <i>Prince Albert</i>
to return home, and the <i>Advance</i> to make
further explorations. It was off Leopold Island,
on the 23d of August, that the "mad Yankee"
took the lead through the vast masses of floating
ice, so vividly described by Mr. Snow, and so
graphically portrayed by the sailor-artist. "The
way was before them," says Mr. Snow, who stood
upon the deck of the <i>Advance</i>; "the stream of
ice had to be either gone through boldly, or a
long <i>detour</i> made; and, despite the heaviness of
the stream, <i>they pushed the vessel through in her
proper course</i>. Two or three shocks, as she came
in contact with some large pieces, were unheeded;
and the moment the last block was past
the bow, the officer sung out,'So: steady as she
goes on her course;' and came aft as if nothing
more than ordinary sailing had been going on.
I observed our own little bark nobly following
in the American's wake; and as I afterward
learned, she got through it pretty well, though
not without much doubt of the propriety of keeping
on in such procedure after the 'mad Yankee,'
as he was called by our mate."</p>

<p>From Leopold Island the <i>Advance</i> proceeded
to the northwest, and on the 25th reached Cape
Riley, another amorphous mass, not so regular
and precipitate as Leopold Island, but more lofty.
Here a strong tide, setting in to the shore, drifted
the <i>Advance</i> toward the beach, where she stranded.
Around her were small bergs and large masses
of floating ice, all under the influence of the strong
current. It was about two o'clock in the afternoon
when she struck. By diligent labor in removing
every thing from her deck to a small <i>floe</i>,
she was so lightened, that at four o'clock the next
morning she floated, and soon every thing was
properly replaced.</p>

</div>

<p>Near Cape Riley the Americans fell in with
a portion of an English Expedition, and there
also the <i>Rescue</i>, left behind in the gale in Lancaster
Sound, overtook the <i>Advance</i>. There
was Captain Penny with the <i>Sophia</i> and <i>Lady
Franklin</i>; the veteran Sir John Ross, with the
<i>Felix</i>, and Commodore Austin, with the <i>Resolute</i>
steamer. Together the navigators of both nations
explored the coast at and near Cape Riley,
and on the 27th they saw in a cove on the shore
of Beechy Island, or Beechy Cape, on the east
side of the entrance to Wellington Channel,
unmistakable evidence that Sir John Franklin
and his companions were there in April, 1846.
There they found many articles known to belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to the British Navy, and some that were
the property of the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>, the ships
under the command of Sir John. There lay,
bleached to the whiteness of the surrounding
snow, a piece of <i>canvas</i>, with the name of the <i>Terror</i>,
marked upon it with indestructible charcoal.
It was very faint, yet perfectly legible. Near it
was a <i>guide board</i>,
lying flat upon its
face, having been
prostrated by the
wind. It had evidently
been used to
direct exploring parties
to the vessels,
or, rather, to the encampment
on shore.
The board was pine,
thirteen inches in
length and six and a
half in breadth, and
nailed to a boarding
pike eight feet in
length. It is supposed
that the sudden
opening of the
ice, caused Sir John to depart hastily, and that in
so doing, this pike and its board were left behind.
They also found a large number of <i>tin canisters</i>,
such as are used for packing meats for a sea
voyage; an <i>anvil block</i>; remnants of clothing,
which evinced, by numerous patches and their
threadbare character, that they had been worn as
long as the owners could keep them on; the remains
of an <i>India rubber glove</i>, lined with wool;
some old <i>sacks</i>; a <i>cask</i>, or tub, partly filled with
charcoal, and an unfinished <i>rope-mat</i>, which, like
other fibrous fabrics, was bleached white.</p>

<p>But the most interesting, and at the same time
most melancholy traces of the navigators, were
<i>three graves</i>, in a little sheltered cove, each with
a board at the head, bearing the name of the
sleeper below. These inscriptions testify positively
when Sir John and his companions were
there. The board at the head of the grave on
the left has the following inscription:</p>

<p>"Sacred to the memory of <span class="smcap">John Torrington</span>,
who departed this life, January 1st, <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>, 1846, on
board her Majesty's ship <i>Terror</i>, aged 20 years."</p>

<p>On the centre one&mdash;"Sacred to the memory
of <span class="smcap">John Hartnell</span>, A. B., of her Majesty's ship
<i>Erebus</i>; died, January 4th, 1846, aged 25 years.
'Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Consider your
ways:' Haggai, chap. i. v. 7."</p>

<p>On the right&mdash;"Sacred to the memory of W.
<span class="smcap">Braine</span>, R. M., of her Majesty's ship <i>Erebus</i>, who
died April 3d, 1846, aged 32 years. 'Choose you
this day whom you will serve:' Joshua, chap.
xxiv., part of the 15th verse."</p>

</div>

<p>How much later than April 3d (the date upon
the last-named head-board), Sir John remained at
Beechy, can not be determined. They saw evidences
of his having gone northward, for sledge
tracks in that direction were very visible. It is
the opinion of Dr. Kane that, on the breaking up
of the ice, in the spring, Sir John passed northward
with his ships through Wellington Channel,
into the great Polar basin, and that he did not
return. This, too, is the opinion of Captain
Penny, and he zealously urges the British government
to send a powerful screw steamer to pass
through that channel, and explore the <i>theoretically</i>
more hospitable coasts beyond. This will
doubtless be undertaken another season, it being
the opinions of Captains Parry, Beechy, Sir John
Ross, and others, expressed at a conference with
the Board of Admiralty, in September, that the
season was too far advanced to attempt it the
present year. Dr. Kane, in a letter to Mr. Grinnell,
since the return of the expedition, thus expresses
his opinion concerning the safety of Sir
John and his companions. After saying, "I should
think that he is now to be sought for north and west
of Cornwallis Island," he adds, "as to the chance
of the destruction of his party by the casualties of
ice, the return of our own party after something
more than the usual share of them, is the only
<i>fact</i> that I can add to what we knew when we
set out. The hazards from cold and privation of
food may be almost looked upon as subordinate.
The snow-hut, the fire and light from the moss-lamp
fed with blubber, the seal, the narwhal, the
white whale, and occasionally abundant stores of
migratory birds, would sustain vigorous life. The
scurvy, the worst visitation of explorers deprived
of permanent quarters, is more rare in the depths
of a Polar winter, than in the milder weather of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the moist summer; and our two little vessels encountered
both seasons without losing a man."</p>

<p>Leaving Beechy Cape, our expedition forced its
way through the ice to Barlow's Inlet, where they
narrowly escaped being frozen in for the winter.
They endeavored to enter the Inlet, for the purpose
of making it their winter quarters, but were
prevented by the mass of <i>pack-ice</i> at its entrance.
It was on the 4th of September, 1850, when they
arrived there, and after remaining seven or eight
days, they abandoned the attempt to enter. On
the right and left of the above picture, are seen
the dark rocks at the entrance of the Inlet, and
in the centre the frozen waters and the range of
hills beyond. There was much smooth ice within
the Inlet, and while the vessels lay anchored
to the "field," officers and crew exercised and
amused themselves by skating. On the left of
the Inlet, (indicated by the dark conical object,)
they discovered a <i>Cairn</i> (a heap of stones with
a cavity) eight or ten feet in height, which was
erected by Captain Ommanny of the English Expedition
then in the Polar waters. Within it he
had placed two letters, for "whom it might concern."
Commander De Haven also deposited a
letter there. It is believed to be the only post-office
in the world, free for the use of all nations.
The rocks, here, presented vast fissures made by
the frost; and at the foot of the cliff on the right,
that powerful agent had cast down vast heaps of
<i>debris</i>.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ADVANCE AND RESCUE AT BARLOW&#39;S INLET.</span>
</div>

<p>From Barlow's Inlet, our Expedition moved
slowly westward, battling with the ice every
rood of the way, until they reached Griffin's
Island, at about 96&deg; west longitude from Greenwich.
This was attained on the 11th, and was
the extreme westing made by the expedition.
All beyond seemed impenetrable ice; and, despairing
of making any further discoveries before
the winter should set in, they resolved to return
home. Turning eastward, they hoped to reach
Davis's Straits by the southern route, before
the cold and darkness came on, but they were
doomed to disappointment. Near the entrance
to Wellington Channel they became completely
locked in by <i>hummock-ice</i>, and soon found themselves
drifting with an irresistible tide up that
channel toward the pole.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 658px;">

<span class="caption">ADVANCE AND RESCUE DRIFTING IN WELLINGTON SOUND.</span>
</div>

<p>Now began the most perilous adventures of
the navigators. The summer day was drawing
to a close; the diurnal visits of the pale sun
were rapidly shortening, and soon the long polar
night, with all its darkness and horrors, would
fall upon them. Slowly they drifted in those
vast fields of ice, whither, or to what result, they
knew not. Locked in the moving yet compact
mass; liable every moment to be crushed; far
away from land; the mercury sinking daily
lower and lower from the zero figure, toward the
point where that metal freezes, they felt small
hope of ever reaching home again. Yet they
prepared for winter comforts and winter sports,
as cheerfully as if lying safe in Barlow's Inlet.
As the winter advanced, the crews of both vessels
went on board the larger one. They unshipped
the rudders of each to prevent their being injured
by the ice, covered the deck of the <i>Advance</i> with
felt, prepared their stores, and made arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
for enduring the long winter, now upon them.
Physical and mental activity being necessary
for the preservation of health, they daily exercised
in the open air for several hours. They
built ice huts, hunted the huge white bears and
the little polar foxes, and when the darkness of
the winter night had spread over them, they
arranged in-door amusements and employments.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/illo_21.jpg" width="309" height="214" alt="SITUATION OF THE ADVANCE IN BARROW&#39;S STRAITS" title="" />
<span class="caption">SITUATION OF THE ADVANCE IN BARROW&#39;S STRAITS</span>
</div>

<p>Before the end of October, the sun made its
appearance for the last time, and the awful polar
night closed in. Early in November they wholly
abandoned the <i>Rescue</i>, and both crews made
the <i>Advance</i> their permanent winter home. The
cold soon became intense; the mercury congealed,
and the spirit thermometer indicated 46&deg;
below zero! Its average range was 30&deg; to 35&deg;.
They had drifted helplessly up Wellington Channel
as high as the point 4. on the map, almost to
the latitude from whence Captain Penny saw an
open sea, and which all believe to be the great
polar basin, where there is a more genial clime
than that which intervenes between the Arctic
Circle and the 75th degree. Here, when almost
in sight of the open ocean, that mighty polar
tide, with its vast masses of ice, suddenly ebbed,
and our little vessels were carried back as resistlessly
as before, through Barrow's Straits into
Lancaster Sound! All this while the immense
fields of <i>hummock-ice</i> were moving, and the
vessels were in hourly danger of being crushed
and destroyed. At length, while drifting through
Barrow's Straits, the congealed mass, as if crushed
together by the opposite shores, became more
compact, and the <i>Advance</i> was elevated almost
seven feet by the stern, and keeled two feet eight
inches, starboard, as seen in the engraving. In
this position she remained, with very little alteration,
for five consecutive months; for, soon
after entering Baffin's Bay in the midst of the
winter, the ice became frozen in one immense
tract, covering millions of acres. Thus frozen
in, sometimes more than a hundred miles from
land, they drifted slowly along the southwest
coast of Baffin's Bay, a distance of more than a
thousand miles from Wellington Channel. For
eleven weeks that dreary night continued, and
during that time the disc of the sun was never
seen above the horizon. Yet nature was not
wholly forbidding in aspect. Sometimes the
Aurora Borealis would flash up still further
northward; and sometimes Aurora Parhelia&mdash;mock
suns and mock moons&mdash;would appear in
varied beauty in the starry sky. Brilliant, too,
were the northern constellations; and when the
real moon was at its full, it made its stately
circuit in the heavens without descending below
the horizon, and lighted up the vast piles of ice
with a pale lustre, almost as great as the morning
twilights of more genial skies.</p>

<p>Around the vessels the crews built a wall of
ice; and in ice huts they stowed away their
cordage and stores to make room for exercise on
the decks. They organized a theatrical company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and amused themselves and the officers
with comedy well performed. Behind the pieces
of <i>hummock</i> each actor learned his part, and by
means of calico they transformed themselves into
female characters, as occasion required. These
dramas were acted upon the deck of the <i>Advance</i>,
sometimes while the thermometer indicated 30&deg;
below zero, and actors and audience highly enjoyed
the fun. They also went out in parties
during that long night, fully armed, to hunt the
polar bear, the grim monarch of the frozen North,
on which occasions they often encountered perilous
adventures. They played at foot-ball, and
exercised themselves in drawing sledges, heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
laden with provisions. Five hours of each twenty-four,
they thus exercised in the open air, and
once a week each man washed his whole body in
cold snow water. Serious sickness was consequently
avoided, and the scurvy which attacked
them soon yielded to remedies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 679px;">

<span class="caption">ADVANCE AND RESCUE DURING THE WINTER OF 1850-51.</span>
</div>

<p>Often during that fearful night, they expected
the disaster of having their vessels crushed. All
through November and December, before the ice
became fast, they slept in their clothes, with
knapsacks on their backs, and sledges upon the
ice, laden with stores, not knowing at what
moment the vessels might be demolished, and
themselves forced to leave them and make their
way toward land. On the 8th of December, and
the 23d of January, they actually lowered their
boats and stood upon the ice, for the crushing
masses were making the timbers of the gallant
vessel creak and its decks to rise in the centre.
They were then ninety miles from land, and
hope hardly whispered an encouraging idea of
life being sustained. On the latter occasion,
when officers and crew stood upon the ice, with
the ropes of their provision sledges in their
hands, a terrible snow-drift came from the northeast,
and intense darkness shrouded them. Had
the vessel then been crushed, all must have
perished. But God, who ruled the storm, also
put forth his protecting arm and saved them.</p>

<p>Early in February the northern horizon began
to be streaked with gorgeous twilight, the herald
of the approaching king of day; and on the 18th
the disc of the sun first appeared above the horizon.
As its golden rim rose above the glittering
snow-drifts and piles of ice, three hearty cheers
went up from those hardy mariners, and they
welcomed their deliverer from the chains of frost
as cordially as those of old who chanted,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See! the conquering hero comes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sound the trumpet, beat the drums."<br /></span>

<span class="caption">STERN OF THE RESCUE IN THE ICE.</span></div>

<p>Day after day it rose higher and higher, and
while the pallid faces of the voyagers, bleached
during that long night, darkened by its beams, the
vast masses of ice began to yield to its fervid
influences. The scurvy disappeared, and from
that time, until their arrival home, not a man
suffered from sickness. As they slowly drifted
through Davis's Straits, and the ice gave indications
of breaking up, the voyagers made preparations
for sailing. The <i>Rescue</i> was re-occupied,
(May 13th 1851), and her stern-post, which had
been broken by the ice in Barrow's Straits, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
repaired. To accomplish this, they were obliged
to dig away the ice which was from 12 to 14 feet
thick around her, as represented in the engraving.
They re-shipped their rudders; removed the felt
covering; placed their stores on deck, and then
patiently awaited the disruption of the ice. This
event was very sudden and appalling. It began
to give way on the 5th of June, and in the space
of twenty minutes the whole mass, as far as the
eye could reach became one vast field of moving
<i>floes</i>. On the 10th of June they emerged into
open water (7, on the map) a little south of the
Arctic Circle, in latitude 65&deg; 30'. They immediately
repaired to Godhaven, on the coast of
Greenland, where they re-fitted, and, unappalled
by the perils through which they had just
passed, they once more turned their prows northward
to encounter anew the ice squadrons of
Baffin's Bay. Again they traversed the coast of
Greenland to about the 73d degree, when they
bore to the westward, and on the 7th and 8th of
July passed the English whaling fleet near the
Dutch Islands. Onward they pressed through
the accumulating ice to Baffin's Island, where,
on the 11th, they were joined by the <i>Prince Albert</i>,
then out upon another cruise. They continued
in company until the 3d of August, when
the <i>Albert</i> departed for the westward, determined
to try the more southern passage. Here again
(8,) our expedition encountered vast fields of <i>hummock-ice</i>,
and were subjected to the most imminent
perils. The floating ice, as if moved by
adverse currents, tumbled in huge masses, and
reared upon the sides of the sturdy little vessels
like monsters of the deep intent upon destruction.
These masses broke in the bulwarks, and sometimes
fell over upon the decks with terrible force,
like rocks rolled over a plain by mountain torrents.
The noise was fearful; so deafening that
the mariners could scarcely hear each other's
voices. The sounds of these rolling masses, together
with the rending of the icebergs floating
near, and the vast <i>floes</i>, produced a din like the
discharge of a thousand pieces of ordnance upon
a field of battle.</p>

<p>Finding the north and west closed against further
progress, by impenetrable ice, the brave De
Haven was balked, and turning his vessels homeward,
they came out into an open sea, somewhat
crippled, but not a plank seriously started. During
a storm off the banks of Newfoundland, a
thousand miles from New York, the vessels parted
company. The <i>Advance</i> arrived safely at the
Navy Yard at Brooklyn on the 30th of September,
and the <i>Rescue</i> joined her there a few days afterward.
Toward the close of October the government
resigned the vessels into the hands of Mr.
Grinnell, to be used in other service, but with
the stipulation that they are to be subject to the
order of the Secretary of the Navy in the spring,
if required for another expedition in search of
Sir John Franklin.</p>

<p>We have thus given a very brief account of
the principal events of interest connected with
the American Arctic Expedition; the officers of
which will doubtless publish a more detailed narrative.
Aside from the success which attended
our little vessels in encountering the perils of the
polar seas, there are associations which must
forever hallow the effort as one of the noblest
exhibitions of the true glory of nations. The
navies of America and England have before met
upon the ocean, but they met for deadly strife.
Now, too, they met for strife, equally determined,
but not with each other. They met in the holy
cause of benevolence and human sympathy, to
battle with the elements beneath the Arctic Circle;
and the chivalric heroism which the few
stout hearts of the two nations displayed in that
terrible conflict, redounds a thousand-fold more
to the glory of the actors, their governments, and
the race, than if four-score ships, with ten thousand
armed men had fought for the mastery of
each other upon the broad ocean, and battered
hulks and marred corpses had gone down to the
coral caves of the sea, a dreadful offering to the
demon of Discord. In the latter event, troops of
widows and orphan children would have sent up
a cry of wail; now, the heroes <i>advanced</i> manfully
to <i>rescue</i> husbands and fathers to restore them to
their wives and children. How glorious the
thought! and how suggestive of the beauty of that
fast approaching day, when the nations shall sit
down in peace as united children of one household.</p>

<h2>NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>

<h3>BY JOHN S. C. ABBOTT.</h3>

<h4>CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST ITALIAN CAMPAIGN.</h4>


<p>Mantua had now fallen. The Austrians
were driven from Italy. The Pope, with
the humility of a child, had implored the clemency
of the conqueror. Still Austria refused to
make peace with republican France, and with
indomitable perseverance gathered her resources
for another conflict. Napoleon resolved to march
directly upon Vienna. His object was peace,
not conquest. In no other possible way could
peace be attained. It was a bold enterprise.
Leaving the whole breadth of Italy between his
armies and France, he prepared to cross the rugged
summits of the Carnic Alps, and to plunge,
with an army of but fifty thousand men, into the
very heart of one of the most proud and powerful
empires upon the globe, numbering twenty
millions of inhabitants. Napoleon wished to
make an ally of Venice. To her government
he said, "Your whole territory is imbued with
revolutionary principles. One single word from
me will excite a blaze of insurrection through
all your provinces. Ally yourself with France,
make a few modifications in your government
such as are indispensable for the welfare of the
people, and we will pacify public opinion and
will sustain your authority." Advice more prudent
and humane could not have been given.
The haughty aristocracy of Venice refused the
alliance, raised an army of sixty thousand men,
ready at any moment to fall upon Napoleon's
rear, and demanded neutrality. "Be neutral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
then," said Napoleon, "but remember, if you
violate your neutrality, if you harass my troops,
if you cut off my supplies, I will take ample
vengeance. I march upon Vienna. Conduct
which could be forgiven were I in Italy, will be
unpardonable when I am in Austria. The hour
that witnesses the treachery of Venice, shall
terminate her independence."</p>

<p>Mantua was the birth-place of Virgil. During
centuries of wealth and luxurious ease neither
Italy nor Austria had found time to rear any
monument in honor of the illustrious Mantuan
bard. But hardly had the cannon of Napoleon
ceased to resound around the beleaguered city,
and the smoke of the conflict had hardly passed
away, ere the young conqueror, ever more interested
in the refinements of peace than in the
desolations of war, in the midst of the din of
arms, and contending against the intrigues of
hostile nations, reared a mausoleum and arranged
a gorgeous festival in honor of the immortal
poet. Thus he endeavored to shed renown upon
intellectual greatness, and to rouse the degenerate
Italians to appreciate and to emulate the glory
of their fathers. From these congenial pursuits
of peace he again turned, with undiminished energy,
to pursue the unrelenting assailants of his
country.</p>

<p>Leaving ten thousand men in garrison to watch
the neutrality of the Italian governments, Napoleon,
early in March, removed his head-quarters
to Bassano. He then issued to his troops the
following martial proclamation, which, like bugle
notes of defiance, reverberated over the hostile
and astonished monarchies of Europe. "Soldiers!
the campaign just ended has given you
imperishable renown. You have been victorious
in fourteen pitched battles and seventy actions.
You have taken more than a hundred thousand
prisoners, five hundred field-pieces, two thousand
heavy guns, and four pontoon trains. You have
maintained the army during the whole campaign.
In addition to this you have sent six millions of
dollars to the public treasury, and have enriched
the National Museum with three hundred masterpieces
of the arts of ancient and modern Italy,
which it has required thirty centuries to produce.
You have conquered the finest countries in Europe.
The French flag waves for the first time
upon the Adriatic opposite to Macedon, the native
country of Alexander. Still higher destinies
await you. I know that you will not prove unworthy
of them. Of all the foes that conspired
to stifle the Republic in its birth, the Austrian
Emperor alone remains before you. To obtain
peace we must seek it in the heart of his hereditary
state. You will there find a brave people,
whose religion and customs you will respect, and
whose property you will hold sacred. Remember
that it is liberty you carry to the brave Hungarian
nation."</p>

<p>The Archduke Charles, brother of the king,
was now intrusted with the command of the
Austrian army. His character can not be better
described than in the language of his magnanimous
antagonist. "Prince Charles," said Napoleon,
"is a man whose conduct can never attract
blame. His soul belongs to the heroic
age, but his heart to that of gold. More than
all he is a good man, and that includes every
thing, when said of a prince." Early in March,
Charles, a young man of about Napoleon's age,
who had already obtained renown upon the
Rhine, was in command of an army of 50,000
men stationed upon the banks of the Piave.
From different parts of the empire 40,000 men
were on the march to join him. This would
give him 90,000 troops to array against the
French. Napoleon, with the recruits which he
had obtained from France and Italy, had now a
force of fifty thousand men with which to undertake
this apparently desperate enterprise. The
eyes of all Europe were upon the two combatants.
It was the almost universal sentiment,
that, intoxicated with success, Napoleon was
rushing to irretrievable ruin. But Napoleon
never allowed enthusiasm to run away with his
judgment. His plans were deeply laid, and all
the combinations of chance carefully calculated.</p>

<p>The storms of winter were still howling around
the snow-clad summits of the Alps, and it was
not thought possible that thus early in the season
he would attempt the passage of so formidable a
barrier. A dreadful tempest of wind and rain
swept earth and sky when Napoleon gave the
order to march. The troops, with their accustomed
celerity, reached the banks of the Piave.
The Austrians, astonished at the sudden apparition
of the French in the midst of the elemental
warfare, and unprepared to resist them, hastily
retired some forty miles to the eastern banks of
the Tagliamento. Napoleon closely followed
the retreating foe. At nine o'clock in the morning
of the 10th of March, the French army arrived
upon the banks of the river. Here they
found a wide stream, rippling over a gravelly bed,
with difficulty fordable. The imperial troops, in
most magnificent array, were drawn up upon an
extended plain on the opposite shore. Parks of
artillery were arranged to sweep with grape-shot
the whole surface of the water. In long lines
the infantry, with bristling bayonets and prepared
to rain down upon their foes a storm of bullets,
presented apparently an invincible front. Upon
the two wings of this imposing army vast squadrons
of cavalry awaited the moment, with restless
steeds, when they might charge upon the
foe, should he effect a landing.</p>

<p>The French army had been marching all night
over miry roads, and through mountain defiles.
With the gloom of the night the storm had passed
away, and the cloudless sun of a warm spring
morning dawned upon the valley, as the French
troops arrived upon the banks of the river. Their
clothes were torn, and drenched with rain, and
soiled with mud. And yet it was an imposing
array as forty thousand men, with plumes and
banners and proud steeds, and the music of a
hundred bands, marched down, in that bright sunshine,
upon the verdant meadows which skirted
the Tagliamento. But it was a fearful barrier
which presented itself before them. The rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
river, the vast masses of the enemy in their
strong intrenchments, the frowning batteries,
loaded to the muzzle with grape-shot, to sweep
the advancing ranks, the well fed war-horses in
countless numbers, prancing for the charge, apparently
presented an obstacle which no human
energy could surmount.</p>

<p>Napoleon, seeing the ample preparations made
to oppose him, ordered his troops to withdraw
beyond the reach of the enemies' fire, and to prepare
for breakfast. As by magic the martial array
was at once transformed into a peaceful picnic
scene. Arms were laid aside. The soldiers
threw themselves upon the green grass, just
sprouting in the valley, beneath the rays of the
sun of early spring. Fires were kindled, kettles
boiling, knapsacks opened, and groups, in carelessness
and joviality, gathered around fragments
of bread and meat.</p>

<span class="caption">THE PASSAGE OF THE TAGLIAMENTO.</span>
</div>

<p>The Archduke Charles, seeing that Napoleon
declined the attempt to pass the river until he
had refreshed his exhausted troops, withdrew his
forces also into the rear to their encampments.
When all was quiet, and the Austrians were
thrown completely off their guard, suddenly the
trumpets sounded the preconcerted signal. The
French troops, disciplined to prompt movements,
sprang to their arms, instantly formed in battle
array, plunged into the stream, and, before the
Austrians had recovered from their astonishment,
were half across the river. This movement was
executed with such inconceivable rapidity, as to
excite the admiration as well as the consternation
of their enemies. With the precision and beauty
of the parade ground, the several divisions of the
army gained the opposite shore. The Austrians
rallied as speedily as possible. But it was too
late. A terrible battle ensued. Napoleon was
victor at every point. The Imperial army, with
their ranks sadly thinned, and leaving the ground
gory with the blood of the slain, retreated in confusion
to await the arrival of the reinforcements
coming to their aid. Napoleon pressed upon their
rear, every hour attacking them, and not allowing
them one moment to recover from their panic.
The Austrian troops, thus suddenly and unexpectedly
defeated, were thrown into the extreme
of dejection. The exultant French, convinced of
the absolute invincibility of their beloved chief,
ambitiously sought out points of peril and adventures
of desperation, and with shouts of laughter,
and jokes, and making the welkin ring with songs
of liberty, plunged into the densest masses of their
foes. The different divisions of the army vied
with each other in their endeavor to perform
feats of the most romantic valor, and in the display
of the most perfect contempt of life. In
every fortress, at every mountain pass, upon every
rapid stream, the Austrians made a stand to arrest
the march of the conqueror. But with the footsteps
of a giant, Napoleon crowded upon them,
pouring an incessant storm of destruction upon
their fugitive ranks. He drove the Austrians to
the foot of the mountains. He pursued them up
the steep acclivities. He charged the tempests
of wind and smothering snow with the sound of
the trumpet, and his troops exulted in waging
war with combined man and the elements. Soon
both pursuers and pursued stood upon the summit
of the Carnic Alps. They were in the region
of almost perpetual snow. The vast glaciers,
which seemed memorials of eternity, spread bleak
and cold around them. The clouds floated beneath
their feet. The eagle wheeled and screamed as
he soared over the sombre firs and pines far below
on the mountain sides. Here the Austrians made
a desperate stand. On the storm-washed crags
of granite, behind fields of ice and drifts of snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
which the French cavalry could not traverse, they
sought to intrench themselves against their tireless
pursuer. To retreat down the long and narrow
defiles of the mountains, with the French in
hot pursuit behind, hurling upon them every missile
of destruction, bullets, and balls, and craggy
fragments of the cliffs, was a calamity to be avoided
at every hazard. Upon the summit of Mount
Tarwis, the battle, decisive of this fearful question,
was to be fought. It was an appropriate arena
for the fell deeds of war. Wintry winds swept
the bleak and icy eminence, and a clear, cold,
cloudless sky canopied the two armies as, with
fiend-like ferocity, they hurled themselves upon
each other. The thunder of artillery reverberated
above the clouds. The shout of onset and the
shrieks of the wounded were heard upon eminences
which even the wing of the eagle had
rarely attained. Squadrons of cavalry fell upon
fields of ice, and men and horses were precipitated
into fathomless depths below. The snow
drifts of Mount Tarwis were soon crimsoned with
blood, and the warm current from human hearts
congealed with the eternal glacier, and there, embalmed
in ice, it long and mournfully testified of
man's inhumanity to man.</p>

<p>The Archduke Charles, having exhausted his
last reserve, was compelled to retreat. Many of
the soldiers threw away their arms, and escaped
over the crags of the mountains; thousands were
taken prisoners; multitudes were left dead upon
the ice, and half-buried in the drifts of snow. But
Charles, brave and energetic, still kept the mass
of his army together, and with great skill conducted
his precipitate retreat. With merciless
vigor the French troops pursued, pouring down
upon the retreating masses a perfect storm of
bullets, and rolling over the precipitous sides of
the mountains huge rocks, which swept away
whole companies at once. The bleeding, breathless
fugitives at last arrived in the valley below.
Napoleon followed close in their rear. The Alps
were now passed. The French were in Austria.
They heard a new language. The scenery, the
houses, the customs of the inhabitants, all testified
that they were no longer in Italy. They had
with unparalleled audacity entered the very heart
of the Austrian empire, and with unflinching
resolution were marching upon the capital of
twenty millions of people, behind whose ramparts,
strengthened by the labor of ages, Maria Theresa
had bidden defiance to the invading Turks.</p>

<p>Twenty days had now passed since the opening
of the campaign, and the Austrians were
already driven over the Alps, and having lost a
fourth of their numbers in the various conflicts
which had occurred, dispirited by disaster, were
retreating to intrench themselves for a final struggle
within the walls of Vienna. Napoleon, with
45,000 men, flushed with victory, was rapidly descending
the fertile steams which flow into the
Danube.</p>

<p>Under these triumphant circumstances Napoleon
showed his humanity, and his earnest desire
for peace, in dictating the following most noble
letter, so characteristic of his strong and glowing
intellect. It was addressed to his illustrious adversary,
the Archduke Charles.</p>

<p>"General-in-chief. Brave soldiers, while they
make war, desire peace. Has not this war already
continued six years? Have we not slain
enough of our fellow-men? Have we not inflicted
a sufficiency of woes upon suffering humanity?
It demands repose upon all sides.
Europe, which took up arms against the French
Republic, has laid them aside. Your nation
alone remains hostile, and blood is about to flow
more copiously than ever. This sixth campaign
has commenced with sinister omens. Whatever
may be its issue, many thousand men, on the one
side and the other, must perish. And after all
we must come to an accommodation, for every
thing has an end, not even excepting the passion of
hatred. You, general, who by birth approach so
near the throne, and are above all the little passions
which too often influence ministers and governments,
are you resolved to deserve the title of
benefactor of humanity, and of the real saviour
of Austria. Do not imagine that I deny the possibility
of saving Austria by the force of arms.
But even in such an event your country will not
be the less ravaged. As for myself, if the overture
which I have the honor to make, shall be
the means of saving a single life, I shall be more
proud of the civic crown which I shall be conscious
of having deserved, than of all the melancholy
glory which military success can confer."</p>

<p>To these magnanimous overtures the Archduke
replied: "In the duty assigned to me there is
no power either to scrutinize the causes or to
terminate the duration of the war, I am not invested
with any authority in that respect, and therefore
can not enter into any negotiation for peace."</p>

<p>In this most interesting correspondence, Napoleon,
the plebeian general, speaks with the dignity
and the authority of a sovereign; with a natural,
unaffected tone of command, as if accustomed
from infancy to homage and empire. The brother
of the king is compelled to look upward to the
pinnacle upon which transcendent abilities have
placed his antagonist. The conquering Napoleon
pleads for peace; but Austria hates republican
liberty even more than war. Upon the rejection
of these proposals the thunders of Napoleon's
artillery were again heard, and over the
hills and through the valleys, onward he rushed
with his impetuous troops, allowing his foe no
repose. At every mountain gorge, at every rapid
river, the Austrians stood, and were slain. Each
walled town was the scene of a sanguinary conflict,
and the Austrians were often driven in the
wildest confusion pell-mell with the victors
through the streets. At last they approached
another mountain range called the Stipian Alps.
Here, at the frightful gorge of Neumarkt, a defile
so gloomy and terrific that even the peaceful tourist
can not pass through it unawed, Charles again
made a desperate effort to arrest his pursuers. It
was of no avail. Blood flowed in torrents, thousands
were slain. The Austrians, encumbered
with baggage-wagons and artillery, choked the
narrow passages, and a scene of indescribable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
horror ensued. The French cavalry made most
destructive charges upon the dense masses. Cannon
balls plowed their way through the confused
ranks, and the Austrian rear and the French van
struggled, hand to hand, in the blood-red gorge.
But the Austrians were swept along like withered
leaves before the mountain gales. Napoleon was
now at Leoben. From the eminences around the
city, with the telescope, the distant spires of Vienna
could be discerned. Here the victorious
general halted for a day, to collect his scattered
forces. Charles hurried along the great road to
the capital, with the fragments of his army, striving
to concentrate all the strength of the empire
within those venerable and hitherto impregnable
fortifications.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 673px;">

<span class="caption">THE GORGE OF NEUMARKT.</span>
</div>

<p>All was consternation in Vienna. The king,
dukes, nobles, fled like deer before approaching
hounds, seeking refuge in the distant wilds of
Hungary. The Danube was covered with boats
conveying the riches of the city and the terrified
families out of the reach of danger. Among the
illustrious fugitives was Maria Louisa, then a
child but six years of age, flying from that dreaded
Napoleon whose bride she afterward became. All
the military resources of Austria were immediately
called into requisition; the fortifications
were repaired; the militia organized and drilled;
and in the extremity of mortification and despair
all the energies of the empire were roused for
final resistance. Charles, to gain time, sent a
flag of truce requesting a suspension of arms for
twenty-four hours. Napoleon, too wary to be
caught in a trap which he had recently sprung
upon his foes, replied that moments were precious,
and that they might fight and negotiate at
the same time. Napoleon also issued to the
Austrian people one of his glowing proclamations
which was scattered all over the region he had
overrun. He assured the <i>people</i> that he was their
friend, that he was fighting not for conquest but
for peace; that the Austrian government, bribed
by British gold, was waging an unjust war against
France: that the <i>people</i> of Austria should find in
him a protector, who would respect their religion
and defend them in all their rights. His deeds
were in accordance with his words. The French
soldiers, inspired by the example of their beloved
chief, treated the unarmed Austrians as friends,
and nothing was taken from them without ample
remuneration.</p>

<p>The people of Austria now began to clamor
loudly for peace. Charles, seeing the desperate
posture of affairs, earnestly urged it upon his
brother, the Emperor, declaring that the empire
could no longer be saved by arms. Embassadors
were immediately dispatched from the imperial
court authorized to settle the basis of peace.
They implored a suspension of arms for five days,
to settle the preliminaries. Napoleon nobly replied,
"In the present posture of our military affairs,
a suspension of hostilities must be very
seriously adverse to the interests of the French
army. But if by such a sacrifice, that peace,
which is so desirable and so essential to the happiness
of the people, can be secured, I shall not
regret consenting to your desires." A garden in
the vicinity of Leoben was declared neutral
ground, and here, in the midst of the bivouacs
of the French army, the negotiations were conducted.
The Austrian commissioners, in the
treaty which they proposed, had set down as the
first article, that the Emperor recognized the
French Republic. "Strike that out," said Napoleon,
proudly. "The Republic is like the
sun; none but the blind can fail to see it. We
are our own masters, and shall establish any
government we prefer." This exclamation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
not merely a burst of romantic enthusiasm, but
it was dictated by a deep insight into the possibilities
of the future. "If one day the French
people," he afterward remarked, "should wish
to create a monarchy, the Emperor might object
that he had recognized a republic." Both parties
being now desirous of terminating the war,
the preliminaries were soon settled. Napoleon,
as if he were already the Emperor of France,
waited not for the plenipotentiaries from Paris,
but signed the treaty in his own name. He thus
placed himself upon an equal footing with the
Emperor of Austria. The equality was unhesitatingly
recognized by the Imperial government.
In the settlement of the difficulties between these
two majestic powers, neither of them manifested
much regard for the minor states. Napoleon allowed
Austria to take under her protection many
of the states of Venice, for Venice had proved
treacherous to her professed neutrality, and merited
no protection from his hands.</p>

<span class="caption">THE VENETIAN ENVOYS.</span>
</div>

<p>Napoleon, having thus conquered peace, turned
to lay the rod upon trembling Venice. Richly
did Venice deserve his chastising blows. In
those days, when railroads and telegraphs were
unknown, the transmission of intelligence was
slow. The little army of Napoleon had traversed
weary leagues of mountains and vales, and having
passed beyond the snow-clad summits of the
Alps, were lost to Italian observation, far away
upon the tributaries of the Danube. Rumor,
with her thousand voices filled the air. It was
reported that Napoleon was defeated&mdash;that he
was a captive&mdash;that his army was destroyed.
The Venetian oligarchy, proud, cowardly, and
revengeful, now raised the cry, "Death to the
French." The priests incited the peasants to
frenzy. They attacked unarmed Frenchmen in
the streets and murdered them. They assailed
the troops in garrison with overwhelming numbers.
The infuriated populace even burst into
the hospitals, and poniarded the wounded and
the dying in their beds. Napoleon, who was by
no means distinguished for meekness and long-suffering,
turned sternly to inflict upon them
punishment which should long be remembered.
The haughty oligarchy was thrown into a paroxysm
of terror, when it was announced, that Napoleon
was victor instead of vanquished, and that,
having humbled the pride of Austria, he was
now returning with an indignant and triumphant
army burning for vengeance. The Venetian
Senate, bewildered with fright, dispatched agents
to deprecate his wrath. Napoleon, with a pale
and marble face, received them. Without uttering
a word he listened to their awkward attempts
at an apology, heard their humble submission,
and even endured in silence their offer of millions
of gold to purchase his pardon. Then in tones
of firmness which sent paleness to their cheeks
and palpitation to their hearts, he exclaimed,
"If you could proffer me the treasures of Peru,
could you strew your whole country with gold,
it would not atone for the blood which has been
treacherously spilt. You have murdered my
children. The lion of St. Mark<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> must lick the
dust. Go." The Venetians in their terror sent
enormous sums to Paris, and succeeded in bribing
the Directory, ever open to such appeals. Orders
were accordingly transmitted to Napoleon, to
spare the ancient Senate and aristocracy of
Venice. But Napoleon, who despised the Directory,
and who was probably already dreaming
of its overthrow, conscious that he possessed
powers which they could not shake, paid no
attention to their orders. He marched resistlessly
into the dominions of the doge. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
thunders of Napoleon's cannon were reverberating
across the lagoons which surround the Queen of
the Adriatic. The doge, pallid with consternation,
assembled the Grand Council, and proposed
the surrender of their institutions to Napoleon,
to be remodeled according to his pleasure. While
they were deliberating, the uproar of insurrection
was heard in the streets. The aristocrats and
the republicans fell furiously upon each other.
The discharge of fire-arms was heard under the
very windows of the council-house. Opposing
shouts of "Liberty forever," and "Long live St.
Mark," resounded through the streets. The city
was threatened with fire and pillage. Amid this
horrible confusion three thousand French soldiers
crossed the lagoons in boats and entered the city.
They were received with long shouts of welcome
by the populace, hungering for republican liberty.
Resistance was hopeless. An unconditional surrender
was made to Napoleon, and thus fell one
of the most execrable tyrannies this world has
ever known. The course Napoleon then pursued
was so magnanimous as to extort praise from his
bitterest foes. He immediately threw open the
prison doors to all who were suffering for political
opinions. He pardoned all offenses against
himself. He abolished aristocracy, and established
a popular government, which should fairly
represent all classes of the community. The
public debt was regarded as sacred, and even the
pensions continued to the poor nobles. It was
a glorious reform for the Venetian nation. It
was a terrible downfall for the Venetian aristocracy.
The banner of the new republic now
floated from the windows of the palace, and as it
waved exultingly in the breeze, it was greeted
with the most enthusiastic acclamations, by the
people who had been trampled under the foot of
oppression for fifteen hundred years.</p>

<p>All Italy was now virtually at the feet of
Napoleon. Not a year had yet elapsed since he,
a nameless young man of twenty-five years of
age, with thirty thousand ragged and half starved
troops, had crept along the shores of the Mediterranean,
hoping to surprise his powerful foes.
He had now traversed the whole extent of Italy,
compelled all its hostile states to respect republican
France, and had humbled the Emperor of
Austria as emperor had rarely been humbled before.
The Italians, recognizing him as a countryman,
and proud of his world-wide renown, regarded
him, not as a conqueror, but as a liberator.
His popularity was boundless. Wherever
he appeared the most enthusiastic acclamations
welcomed him. Bonfires blazed upon every hill
in honor of his movements. The bells rang their
merriest peals, wherever he appeared. Long
lines of maidens strewed roses in his path. The
reverberations of artillery and the huzzas of the
populace saluted his footsteps. Europe was at
peace; and Napoleon was the great pacificator.
For this object he had contended against the
most formidable coalitions. He had sheathed
his victorious sword, the very moment his enemies
were willing to retire from the strife.</p>

<p>Still the position of Napoleon required the
most consummate firmness and wisdom. All the
states of Italy, Piedmont, Genoa, Naples, the
States of the Church, Parma, Tuscany, were agitated
with the intense desire for liberty. Napoleon
was unwilling to encourage insurrection.
He could not lend his arms to oppose those who
were struggling for popular rights. In Genoa,
the patriots rose. The haughty aristocracy fell
in revenge upon the French, who chanced to be
in the territory. Napoleon was thus compelled to
interfere. The Genoese aristocracy were forced
to abdicate, and the patriot party, as in Venice,
assumed the government. But the Genoese
democracy began now in their turn, to trample
upon the rights of their former oppressors.
The revolutionary scenes which had disgraced
Paris, began to be re-enacted in the streets of
Genoa. They excluded the priests and the nobles
from participating in the government, as the
nobles and priests had formerly excluded them.
Acts of lawless violence passed unpunished.
The religion of the Catholic priests was treated
with derision. Napoleon, earnestly and eloquently,
thus urged upon them a more humane
policy. "I will respond, citizens, to the confidence
you have reposed in me. It is not enough
that you refrain from hostility to religion. You
should do nothing which can cause inquietude
to tender consciences. To exclude the nobles
from any public office, is an act of extreme injustice.
You thus repeat the wrong which you
condemn in them. Why are the people of Genoa
so changed? Their first impulses of fraternal
kindness have been succeeded by fear and terror.
Remember that the priests were the first who
rallied around the tree of liberty. They first
told you that the morality of the gospel is democratic.
Men have taken advantage of the faults,
perhaps of the crimes of individual priests,
to unite against Christianity. You have proscribed
without discrimination. When a state
becomes accustomed to condemn without hearing,
to applaud a discourse because it impassioned;
when exaggeration and madness are called virtue,
moderation and equity designated as crimes, that
state is near its ruin. Believe me, I shall consider
<i>that</i> one of the happiest moments of my life in
which I hear that the people of Genoa are united
among themselves and live happily."</p>

<p>This advice, thus given to Genoa, was intended
to re-act upon France, for the Directory then had
under discussion a motion for banishing all the
nobles from the Republic. The voice of Napoleon
was thus delicately and efficiently introduced
into the debate, and the extreme and terrible
measure was at once abandoned.</p>

<p>Napoleon performed another act at this time,
which drew down upon him a very heavy load
of obloquy from the despotic governments of
Europe, but which must secure the approval of
every generous mind. There was a small state
in Italy called the Valteline, eighteen miles wide,
and fifty-four miles long, containing one hundred
and sixty thousand inhabitants. These unfortunate
people had become subjects to a German
state called the Grisons, and, deprived of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
political privileges, were ground down by the
most humiliating oppression. The inhabitants
of the Valteline, catching the spirit of liberty, revolted
and addressed a manifesto to all Europe,
setting forth their wrongs, and declaring their
determination to recover those rights, of which
they had been defrauded. Both parties sent
deputies to Napoleon, soliciting his interference,
virtually agreeing to abide by his decision. Napoleon,
to promote conciliation and peace, proposed
that the Valtelines should remain with the
Grisons as one people, and that the Grisons
should confer upon them equal political privileges
with themselves. Counsel more moderate
and judicious could not have been given. But
the proud Grisons, accustomed to trample upon
their victims, with scorn refused to share with
them the rights of humanity. Napoleon then issued
a decree, saying, "<i>It is not just that one
people should be subject to another people.</i> Since
the Grisons have refused equal rights to the inhabitants
of the Valteline, the latter are at liberty
to unite themselves with the Cisalpine Republic."
This decision was received with bursts of
enthusiastic joy by the liberated people, and they
were immediately embraced within the borders
of the new republic.</p>

<p>The great results we have thus far narrated in
this chapter were accomplished in six weeks.
In the face of powerful armies, Napoleon had
traversed hundreds of miles of territory. He had
forded rivers, with the storm of lead and iron
falling pitilessly around him. He had crossed
the Alps, dragging his artillery through snow
three feet in depth, scattered the armies of Austria
to the winds, imposed peace upon that proud
and powerful empire, recrossed the Alps, laid low
the haughty despotism of Venice, established a
popular government in the emancipated provinces,
and revolutionized Genoa. Josephine was
now with him in the palace of Milan. From
every state in Italy couriers were coming and
going, deprecating his anger, soliciting his counsel,
imploring his protection. The destiny of
Europe seemed to be suspended upon his decisions.
His power transcended that of all the
potentates in Europe. A brilliant court of beautiful
ladies surrounded Josephine, and all vied to
do homage to the illustrious conqueror. The
enthusiastic Italians thronged his gates, and
waited for hours to catch a glance of the youthful
hero. The feminine delicacy of his physical
frame, so disproportionate with his mighty renown,
did but add to the enthusiasm which his presence
ever inspired. His strong arm had won for
France peace with all the world, England alone
excepted. The indomitable islanders, protected
by the ocean from the march of invading armies,
still continued the unrelenting warfare. Wherever
her navy could penetrate she assailed the
French, and as the horrors of war could not reach
her shores, she refused to live on any terms of
peace with Republican France.</p>

<p>Napoleon now established his residence, or
rather his court, at Montebello, a beautiful palace
in the vicinity of Milan. His frame was
emaciate in the extreme from the prodigious toils
which he had endured. Yet he scarcely allowed
himself an hour of relaxation. Questions of vast
moment, relative to the settlement of political
affairs in Italy, were yet to be adjusted, and Napoleon,
exhausted as he was in body, devoted the
tireless energies of his mind to the work. His
labors were now numerous. He was treating
with the plenipotentiaries of Austria, organizing
the Italian Republic, creating a navy in the Adriatic,
and forming the most magnificent projects
relative to the Mediterranean. These were the
works in which he delighted, constructing canals,
and roads, improving harbors, erecting bridges,
churches, naval and military d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts, calling cities
and navies into existence, awaking every where
the hum of prosperous industry. All the states
of Italy were imbued with local prejudices and
petty jealousies of each other. To break down
these jealousies, he endeavored to consolidate
the Republicans into one single state, with Milan
for the capital. He strove in multiplied ways
to rouse martial energy among the effeminate
Italians. Conscious that the new republic could
not long stand alive in the midst of the surrounding
monarchies so hostile to its existence, that it
could only be strong by the alliance of France,
he conceived the design of a high road, broad,
safe, and magnificent, from Paris to Geneva,
thence across the Simplon through the plains of
Lombardy to Milan. He was in treaty with the
government of Switzerland, for the construction
of the road through its territories; and had sent
engineers to explore the route and make an estimate
of the expense. He himself arranged all
the details with the greatest precision. He contemplated
also, at the same time, with the deepest
interest and solicitude, the empire which England
had gained on the seas. To cripple the
power of this formidable foe, he formed the design
of taking possession of the islands of the
Mediterranean. "From these different posts,"
he wrote to the Directory, "we shall command
the Mediterranean, we shall keep an eye upon the
Ottoman empire, which is crumbling to pieces,
and we shall have it in our power to render the
dominion of the ocean almost useless to the English.
They have possession of the Cape of
Good Hope. We can do without it. <i>Let us
occupy Egypt.</i> We shall be in the direct road
for India. It will be easy for us to found there
one of the finest colonies in the world. <i>It is in
Egypt that we must attack England.</i>"</p>

<p>It was in this way that Napoleon <i>rested</i> after
the toils of the most arduous campaigns mortal
man had ever passed through. The Austrians
were rapidly recruiting their forces from their
vast empire, and now began to throw many difficulties
in the way of a final adjustment. The
last conference between the negotiating parties
was held at Campo Formio, a small village about
ten miles east of the Tagliamento. The commissioners
were seated at an oblong table, the
four Austrian negotiators upon one side, Napoleon
by himself upon the other. The Austrians
demanded terms to which Napoleon could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
accede, threatening at the same time that if Napoleon
did not accept these terms, the armies of
Russia would be united with those of Austria,
and France should be compelled to adopt those
less favorable. One of the Austrian commissioners
concluded an insulting apostrophe, by saying,
"Austria desires peace, and she will severely
condemn the negotiator who sacrifices the interest
and repose of his country to military ambition."
Napoleon, cool and collected, sat in silence
while these sentiments were uttered. Then
rising from the table he took from the sideboard
a beautiful porcelain vase. "Gentlemen," said
he, "the truce is broken; war is declared. But
remember, in three months I will demolish your
monarchy as I now shatter this porcelain." With
these words he dashed the vase into fragments
upon the floor, and bowing to the astounded negotiators,
abruptly withdrew. With his accustomed
promptness of action he instantly dispatched
an officer to the Archduke, to inform him that
hostilities would be re-commenced in twenty-four
hours; and entering his carriage, urged his
horses with the speed of the wind, toward the
head-quarters of the army. One of the conditions
of this treaty upon which Napoleon insisted, was
the release of La Fayette, then imprisoned for his
republican sentiments, in the dungeons of Olmutz.
The Austrian plenipotentiaries were thunderstruck
by this decision, and immediately agreed
to the terms which Napoleon demanded. The
next day at five o'clock the treaty of Campo Formio
was signed.</p>

<span class="caption">THE CONFERENCE DISSOLVED.</span>
</div>

<p>The terms which Napoleon offered the Austrians
in this treaty, though highly advantageous
to France, were far more lenient to Austria, than
that government had any right to expect. The
Directory in Paris, anxious to strengthen itself
against the monarchical governments of Europe
by revolutionizing the whole of Italy and founding
there republican governments, positively forbade
Napoleon to make peace with Austria, unless
the freedom of the Republic of Venice was
recognized. Napoleon wrote to the Directory
that if they insisted upon that ultimatum, the
renewal of the war would be inevitable. The
Directory replied, "Austria has long desired to
swallow up Italy, and to acquire maritime power.
It is the interest of France to prevent both of these
designs. It is evident that if the Emperor acquires
Venice, with its territorial possessions, he will
secure an entrance into the whole of Lombardy.
We should be treating as if we had been conquered.
What would posterity say of us if we
surrender that great city with its naval arsenals
to the Emperor. The whole question comes
to this: Shall we give up Italy to the Austrians?
The French government neither can nor
will do so. It would prefer all the hazards of
war."</p>

<p>Napoleon wished for peace. He could only
obtain it by disobeying the orders of his government.
The middle of October had now arrived.
One morning, at daybreak, he was informed that
the mountains were covered with snow. Leaping
from his bed, he ran to the window, and saw
that the storms of winter had really commenced
on the bleak heights. "What! before the middle
of October!" he exclaimed: "what a country
is this! Well, we must make peace." He
shut himself up in his cabinet for an hour, and
carefully reviewed the returns of the army. "I
can not have," said he to Bourrienne, "more
than sixty thousand men in the field. Even if
victorious I must lose twenty thousand in killed
and wounded. And how, with forty thousand,
can I withstand the whole force of the Austrian
monarchy, who will hasten to the relief of Vienna?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
The armies of the Rhine could not advance
to my succor before the middle of November,
and before that time arrives the Alps will be
impassable from snow. It is all over. I will
sign the peace. The government and the lawyers
may say what they choose."</p>

<p>This treaty, extended France to the Rhine,
recognized the Cisalpine Republic, composed of
the Cispadane Republic and Lombardy, and allowed
the Emperor of Austria to extend his
sway over several of the states of Venice. Napoleon
was very desirous of securing republican
liberty in Venice. Most illustriously did he exhibit
his anxiety for peace in consenting to sacrifice
that desire, and to disobey the positive commands
of his government, rather than renew the
horrors of battle. He did not think it his duty to
keep Europe involved in war, that he might secure
republican liberty for Venice, when it was very
doubtful whether the Venetians were sufficiently
enlightened to govern themselves, and when, perhaps,
one half of the nation were so ignorant as
to prefer despotism. The whole glory of this
peace redounds to his honor. His persistence
in that demand which the Directory enjoined,
would but have kindled anew the flames of war.</p>

<p>During these discussions at Campo Formio,
every possible endeavor was made which the
most delicate ingenuity could devise, to influence
Napoleon in his decisions by personal considerations.
The wealth of Europe was literally laid
at his feet. Millions upon millions in gold were
proffered him. But his proud spirit could not be
thus tarnished. When some one alluded to the
different course pursued by the Directors, he replied,
"You are not then aware, citizen, that
there is not one of those Directors whom I could
not bring, for four thousand dollars, to kiss my
boot." The Venetians offered him a present of
one million five hundred thousand dollars. He
smiled, and declined the offer. The Emperor of
Austria, professing the most profound admiration
of his heroic character, entreated him to accept
a principality, to consist of at least two hundred
and fifty thousand inhabitants, for himself and his
heirs. This was indeed an alluring offer to a
young man but twenty-five years of age, and who
had but just emerged from obscurity and poverty.
The young general transmitted his thanks to the
Emperor for this proof of his good-will, but added,
that he could accept of no honors but such as
were conferred upon him by the French people,
and that he should always be satisfied with whatever
they might be disposed to offer.</p>

<img src="images/illo_31.jpg" width="683" height="437" alt="THE COURT AT MILAN." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE COURT AT MILAN.</span>
</div>

<p>While at Montebello, transacting the affairs of
his victorious army, Josephine presided with most
admirable propriety and grace, over the gay circle
of Milan. Napoleon, who well understood the
imposing influence of courtly pomp and splendor,
while extremely simple in his personal habiliments,
dazzled the eyes of the Milanese with all
the pageantry of a court. The destinies of Europe
were even then suspended upon his nod.
He was tracing out the lines of empire, and
dukes, and princes, and kings were soliciting his
friendship. Josephine, by her surpassing loveliness
of person and of character, won universal
admiration. Her wonderful tact, her genius, and
her amiability vastly strengthened the influence
of her husband. "I conquer provinces," said
Napoleon, "but Josephine wins hearts." She
frequently, in after years, reverted to this as the
happiest period of her life. To them both it must
have been as a bewildering dream. But a few
months before, Josephine was in prison, awaiting
her execution; and her children were literally
begging bread in the streets. Hardly a year
had elapsed since Napoleon, a penniless Corsican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
soldier, was studying in a garret in Paris,
hardly knowing where to obtain a single franc.
Now the name of Napoleon was emblazoned
through Europe. He had become more powerful
than the government of his own country. He
was overthrowing and uprearing dynasties. The
question of peace or war was suspended upon his
lips. The proudest potentates of Europe were
ready, at any price, to purchase his favor. Josephine
reveled in the exuberance of her dreamlike
prosperity and exaltation. Her benevolent heart
was gratified with the vast power she now possessed
of conferring happiness. She was beloved,
adored. She had long cherished the desire of
visiting this land, so illustrious in the most lofty
reminiscences. Even Italy can hardly present
a more delightful excursion than the ride from
Milan to the romantic, mountain-embowered lakes
of Como and Maggiore. It was a bright and sunny
Italian morning when Napoleon, with his blissful
bride, drove along the luxuriant valleys and
the vine-clad hill-sides to Lake Maggiore. They
were accompanied by a numerous and glittering
retinue. Here they embarked upon this beautiful
sheet of water, in a boat with silken awnings
and gay banners, and the rowers beat time to the
most voluptuous music. They landed upon Beautiful
Island, which, like another Eden, emerges
from the bosom of the lake. This became the
favorite retreat of Napoleon. Its monastic palace,
so sombre in its antique architecture, was in
peculiar accordance with that strange melancholy
which, with but now and then a ray of sunshine,
ever overshadowed his spirit. On one of these
occasions Josephine was standing upon a terrace
with several ladies, under a large orange-tree,
profusely laden with its golden treasures. As
their attention was all absorbed in admiring the
beautiful landscape, Napoleon slipped up unperceived,
and, by a sudden shake, brought down a
shower of the rich fruit upon their heads. Josephine's
companions screamed with fright and ran;
but she remained unmoved. Napoleon laughed
heartily and said: "Why, Josephine, you stand
fire like one of my veterans." "And why should
I not?" she promptly replied, "am I not the wife
of their general?"</p>

<p>Every conceivable temptation was at this time
presented to entice Napoleon into habits of licentiousness.
Purity was a virtue then and there almost
unknown. Some one speaking of Napoleon's
universal talents, compared him with Solomon.
"Poh," exclaimed another, "What do you mean
by calling him wiser than Solomon. The Jewish
king had seven hundred wives and three hundred
concubines, while Napoleon is contented with one
wife, and she older than himself." The corruption
of those days of infidelity was such, that the
ladies were jealous of Josephine's exclusive influence
over her illustrious spouse, and they exerted
all their powers of fascination to lead him
astray. The loftiness of Napoleon's ambition,
and those principles instilled so early by a mother's
lips as to be almost instincts, were his safeguard.
Josephine was exceedingly gratified,
some of the ladies said, "insufferably vain,"
that Napoleon clung so faithfully and confidingly
to her. "Truly," he said, "I have something
else to think of than love. No man wins triumphs
in that way, without forfeiting some
palms of glory. I have traced out my plan, and
the finest eyes in the world, and there are some
very fine eyes here, shall not make me deviate a
hair's breadth from it."</p>

<p>A lady of rank, after wearying him one day
with a string of the most fulsome compliments,
exclaimed, among other things, "What is life
worth, if one can not be General Bonaparte,"
Napoleon fixed his eyes coldly upon her, and
said, "Madame! one may be a dutiful wife, and
the good mother of a family."</p>

<p>The jealousy which the Directory entertained
of Napoleon's vast accession of power induced
them to fill his court with spies, who watched all
his movements and reported his words. Josephine,
frank and candid and a stranger to all artifice,
could not easily conceal her knowledge or
her thoughts. Napoleon consequently seldom intrusted
to her any plans which he was unwilling
to have made known. "A secret," he once observed,
"is burdensome to Josephine." He was
careful that she should not be thus encumbered.
He would be indeed a shrewd man who could
extort any secret from the bosom of Napoleon.
He could impress a marble-like immovableness
upon his features, which no scrutiny could penetrate.
Said Josephine in subsequent years, "I
never once beheld Napoleon for a moment perfectly
at ease&mdash;not even with myself. He is
constantly on the alert. If at any time he appears
to show a little confidence, it is merely a
feint to throw the person with whom he converses,
off his guard, and to draw forth his sentiments;
but never does he himself disclose his
real thoughts."</p>

<p>The French Government remonstrated bitterly
against the surrender of Venice to Austria.
Napoleon replied. "It costs nothing for a handful
of declaimers to rave about the establishment
of <i>republics</i> every where. I wish these gentlemen
would make a winter campaign. You little know
the people of Italy. You are laboring under a
great delusion. You suppose that liberty can do
great things to a base, cowardly, and superstitious
people. You wish me to perform miracles. I
have not the art of doing so. Since coming into
Italy I have derived little, if any, support from
the love of the Italian people for liberty and
equality."</p>

<p>The treaty of peace signed at Campo Formio,
Napoleon immediately sent to Paris. Though
he had disobeyed the positive commands of the
Directory, in thus making peace, the Directors
did not dare to refuse its ratification. The victorious
young general was greatly applauded by
the people, for refusing the glory of a new campaign,
in which they doubted not that he would
have obtained fresh laurels, that he might secure
peace for bleeding Europe. On the 17th of November
Napoleon left Milan for the Congress at
Rastadt, to which he was appointed, with plenipotentiary
powers. At the moment of leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
he addressed the following proclamation to the
Cisalpine Republic: "We have given you liberty.
Take care to preserve it. To be worthy of your
destiny make only discreet and honorable laws,
and cause them to be executed with energy.
Favor the diffusion of knowledge, and respect
religion. Compose your battalions not of disreputable
men, but of citizens imbued with the
principles of the Republic, and closely linked
with its prosperity. You have need to impress
yourselves with the feeling of your strength, and
with the dignity which befits the free man. Divided
and bowed down by ages of tyranny, you
could not alone have achieved your independence.
In a few years, if true to yourselves, no nation
will be strong enough to wrest liberty from you.
Till then the great nation will protect you."</p>

<p>Napoleon, leaving Josephine at Milan, traveled
rapidly through Piedmont, intending to proceed
by the way of Switzerland to Rastadt. His journey
was an uninterrupted scene of triumph. Illuminations,
processions, bonfires, the ringing of
bells, the explosions of artillery, the huzzas of
the populace, and above all the most cordial and
warm-hearted acclamations of ladies, accompanied
him all the way. The enthusiasm was indescribable.
Napoleon had no fondness for such
displays. He but slightly regarded the applause
of the populace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 657px;">
<img src="images/illo_32.jpg" width="657" height="435" alt="THE TRIUMPHAL JOURNEY." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE TRIUMPHAL JOURNEY.</span>
</div>

<p>"It must be delightful," said Bourrienne, "to
be greeted with such demonstrations of enthusiastic
admiration." "Bah!" Napoleon replied;
"this same unthinking crowd, under a slight
change of circumstances, would follow me just
as eagerly to the scaffold."</p>

<p>Traveling with great rapidity, he appeared
and vanished like a meteor, ever retaining the
same calm, pensive, thoughtful aspect. A person,
who saw him upon this occasion, thus described
his appearance: "I beheld with deep interest
and extreme attention that extraordinary
man, who has performed such great deeds, and
about whom there is something which seems to
indicate that his career is not yet terminated. I
found him much like his portraits, small in stature,
thin, pale, with an air of fatigue, but not as has
been reported in ill-health. He appeared to me
to listen with more abstraction than interest, as
if occupied rather with what he was thinking
of, than with what was said to him. There
is great intelligence in his countenance, along
with an expression of habitual meditation, which
reveals nothing of what is passing within. In
that thinking head, in that daring mind, it is impossible
not to suppose that some designs are
engendering, which will have their influence on
the destinies of Europe." Napoleon did not remain
long at Rastadt, for all the questions of
great political importance were already settled,
and he had no liking for those discussions of
minor points which engrossed the attention of
the petty German princes, who were assembled
at that Congress. He accordingly prepared for
his departure.</p>

<p>In taking leave of the army he thus bade adieu
to his troops. "Soldiers! I leave you to-morrow.
In separating myself from the army I
am consoled with the thought that I shall soon
meet you again, and engage with you in new
enterprises. Soldiers! when conversing among
yourselves of the kings you have vanquished, of
the people upon whom you have conferred liberty,
of the victories you have won in two campaigns,
say, '<i>In the next two we will accomplish
still more.</i>'"</p>

<p>Napoleon's attention was already eagerly directed
to the gorgeous East. These vast kingdoms,
enveloped in mystery, presented just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
realm for his exuberant imagination to range.
It was the theatre, as he eloquently said, "of
mighty empires, where all the great revolutions
of the earth have arisen, where mind had its birth,
and all religions their cradle, and where six hundred
millions of men still have their dwelling-place."</p>

<p>Napoleon left Rastadt, and traveling incognito
through France, arrived in Paris the 7th of December,
1797, having been absent but about
eighteen months. His arrival had been awaited
with the most intense impatience. The enthusiasm
of that most enthusiastic capital had been
excited to the highest pitch. The whole population
were burning with the desire to see the
youthful hero whose achievements seemed to
surpass the fictions of romance. But Napoleon
was nowhere visible. A strange mystery seemed
to envelop him. He studiously avoided observation;
very seldom made his appearance at any
place of public amusement; dressed like the
most unobtrusive private citizen, and glided unknown
through the crowd, whose enthusiasm
was roused to the highest pitch to get a sight
of the hero. He took a small house in the Rue
Chanteraine, which street immediately received
the name of Rue de la Victoire, in honor of Napoleon.
He sought only the society of men of high
intellectual and scientific attainments. In this
course he displayed a profound knowledge of
human nature, and vastly enhanced public curiosity
by avoiding its gratification.</p>

<span class="caption">THE DELIVERY OF THE TREATY.</span>
</div>

<p>The Directory, very jealous of Napoleon's popularity,
yet impelled by the voice of the people,
now prepared a triumphal festival for the delivery
of the treaty of Campo Formio. The
magnificent court of the Luxembourg was arranged
and decorated for this gorgeous show.
At the further end of the court a large platform
was raised, where the five Directors were seated,
dressed in the costume of the Roman Senate, at
the foot of the altar of their country. Embassadors,
ministers, magistrates, and the members of
the two councils were assembled on seats ranged
amphitheatrically around. Vast galleries were
crowded with all that was illustrious in rank,
beauty, and character in the metropolis. Magnificent
trophies, composed of the banners taken
from the enemy, embellished the court, while the
surrounding walls were draped with festoons
of tri-colored tapestry. Bands of music filled the
air with martial sounds, while the very walls of
Paris were shaken by the thunders of exploding
artillery and by the acclamations of the countless
thousands who thronged the court.</p>

<p>It was the 10th of December, 1797. A bright
sun shone through cloudless skies upon the resplendent
scene. Napoleon had been in Paris
but five days. Few of the citizens had as yet
been favored with a sight of the hero, whom all
were impatient to behold. At last a great flourish
of trumpets announced his approach. He
ascended the platform dressed in the utmost simplicity
of a civilian's costume, accompanied by
Talleyrand, and his aids-de-camp, all gorgeously
dressed, and much taller men than himself, but
evidently regarding him with the most profound
homage. The contrast was most striking. Every
eye was riveted upon Napoleon. The thunder
of the cannon was drowned in the still louder
thunder of enthusiastic acclamations which simultaneously
arose from the whole assemblage.
The fountains of human emotion were never more
deeply moved. The graceful delicacy of his fragile
figure, his remarkably youthful appearance,
his pale and wasted cheeks, the classic outline
of his finely moulded features, the indescribable
air of pensiveness and self-forgetfulness which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
he ever carried with him, and all associated with
his most extraordinary achievements, aroused an
intensity of enthusiastic emotion which has perhaps
never been surpassed. No one who witnessed
the scenes of that day ever forgot them.
Talleyrand introduced the hero in a brief and
eloquent speech. "For a moment," said he, in
conclusion, "I did feel on his account that disquietude
which, in an infant republic, arises from
every thing which seems to destroy the equality
of the citizens. But I was wrong. Individual
grandeur, far from being dangerous to equality,
is its highest triumph. And on this occasion
every Frenchman must feel himself elevated by
the hero of his country. And when I reflect upon
all which he has done to shroud from envy that
light of glory; on that ancient love of simplicity
which distinguishes him in his favorite studies;
his love for the abstract sciences; his admiration
for that sublime Ossian which seems to detach
him from the world; on his well known contempt
for luxury, for pomp, for all that constitutes
the pride of ignoble minds, I am convinced
that, far from dreading his ambition, we shall
one day have occasion to rouse it anew to allure
him from the sweets of studious retirement."
Napoleon, apparently quite unmoved by this unbounded
applause, and as calm and unembarrassed
as if speaking to an under-officer in his
tent, thus briefly replied: "Citizens! The French
people, in order to be free, had kings to combat.
To obtain a constitution founded on reason it had
the prejudices of eighteen centuries to overcome.
Priestcraft, feudalism, despotism, have successively,
for two thousand years, governed Europe.
From the peace you have just concluded dates
the era of representative governments. You
have succeeded in organizing the great nation,
whose vast territory is circumscribed only because
nature herself has fixed its limits. You
have done more. The two finest countries in
Europe, formerly so renowned for the arts, the
sciences, and the illustrious men whose cradle
they were, see with the greatest hopes genius
and freedom issuing from the tomb of their ancestors.
I have the honor to deliver to you the
treaty signed at Campo Formio, and ratified by
the emperor. Peace secures the liberty, the
prosperity, and the glory of the Republic. As
soon as the happiness of France is secured by
the best organic laws, the whole of Europe will
be free."</p>

<p>The moment Napoleon began to speak the
most profound silence reigned throughout the
assembly. The desire to hear his voice was so
intense, that hardly did the audience venture to
move a limb or to breathe, while in tones, calm
and clear, he addressed them. The moment he
ceased speaking, a wild burst of enthusiasm filled
the air. The most unimpassioned lost their self-control.
Shouts of "Live Napoleon the conqueror
of Italy, the pacificator of Europe, the saviour
of France," resounded loud and long. Barras,
in the name of the Directory, replied, "Nature,"
exclaimed the orator in his enthusiasm, "has exhausted
her energies in the production of a Bonaparte.
Go," said he turning to Napoleon, "crown
a life, so illustrious, by a conquest which the
great nation owes to its outraged dignity. Go,
and by the punishment of the cabinet of London,
strike terror into the hearts of all who would
miscalculate the powers of a free people. Let
the conquerors of the Po, the Rhine, and the Tiber,
march under your banners. The ocean will
be proud to bear them. It is a slave still indignant
who blushes for his fetters. Hardly will
the tri-colored standard wave on the blood-stained
shores of the Thames, ere an unanimous cry
will bless your arrival, and that generous nation
will receive you as its liberator." Chenier's famous
Hymn to Liberty was then sung in full
chorus, accompanied by a magnificent orchestra.
In the ungovernable enthusiasm of the moment
the five Directors arose and encircled Napoleon in
their arms. The blast of trumpets, the peal of
martial bands, the thunder of cannon, and the
acclamations of the countless multitude rent the
air. Says Thiers, "All heads were overcome
with the intoxication. Thus it was that France
threw herself into the hands of an extraordinary
man. Let us not censure the weakness of our
fathers. That glory reaches us only through
the clouds of time and adversity, and yet it transports
us! Let us say with &AElig;schylus, 'How
would it have been had we seen the monster himself!'"</p>

<p>Napoleon's powers of conversation were inimitable.
There was a peculiarity in every phrase
he uttered which bore the impress of originality
and genius. He fascinated every one who approached
him. He never spoke of his own
achievements, but in most lucid and dramatic
recitals often portrayed the bravery of the army
and the heroic exploits of his generals.</p>

<p>He was now elected a member of the celebrated
Institute, a society composed of the most
illustrious literary and scientific men in France.
He eagerly accepted the invitation, and returned
the following answer. "The suffrages of the
distinguished men who compose the Institute
honor me. I feel sensibly that before I can become
their equal I must long be their pupil. The
only true conquests&mdash;those which awaken no regret&mdash;are
those obtained over ignorance. The
most honorable, as the most useful pursuit of
nations, is that which contributes to the extension
of human intellect. The real greatness of
the French Republic ought henceforth to consist
in the acquisition of the whole sum of human
knowledge, and in not allowing a single new
idea to exist, which does not owe its birth to
their exertions." He laid aside entirely the dress
of a soldier, and, constantly attending the meetings
of the Institute, as a philosopher and a scholar
became one of its brightest ornaments. His
comprehensive mind enabled him at once to
grasp any subject to which he turned his attention.
In one hour he would make himself master
of the accumulated learning to which others
had devoted the labor of years. He immediately,
as a literary man, assumed almost as marked a
pre-eminence among these distinguished scholars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
as he had already acquired as a general on fields
of blood. Apparently forgetting the renown he
had already attained, with boundless ambition he
pressed on to still greater achievements, deeming
nothing accomplished while any thing remained
to be done. Subsequently he referred to his
course at this time and remarked, "Mankind are
in the end always governed by superiority of intellectual
qualities, and none are more sensible
of this than the military profession. When, on
my return from Italy, I assumed the dress of the
Institute, and associated with men of science, I
knew what I was doing, I was sure of not being
misunderstood by the lowest drummer in the
army."</p>

<p>A strong effort was made at this time, by the
royalists, for the restoration of the Bourbons.
Napoleon, while he despised the inefficient government
of the Directory, was by no means willing
that the despotic Bourbons should crush the
spirit of liberty in France. Napoleon was not adverse
to a monarchy. But he wished for a monarch
who would consult the interests of the <i>people</i>,
and not merely pamper the luxury and pride
of the nobles. He formed the plan and guided
the energies which discomfited the royalists,
and sustained the Directors. Thus twice had
the strong arm of this young man protected the
government. The Directors, in their multiplied
perplexities, often urged his presence in their
councils, to advise with them on difficult questions.
Quiet and reserved he would take his
seat at their table, and by that superiority of tact
which ever distinguished him, and by that intellectual
pre-eminence which could not be questioned,
he assumed a moral position far above
them all, and guided those gray-haired diplomatists,
as a father guides his children. Whenever
he entered their presence, he instinctively assumed
the supremacy, and it was instinctively
recognized.</p>

<p>The altars of religion, overthrown by revolutionary
violence, still remained prostrate. The
churches were closed, the Sabbath abolished, the
sacraments were unknown, the priests were in
exile. A whole generation had grown up in
France without any knowledge of Christianity.
Corruption was universal. A new sect sprang
up called Theophilanthropists, who gleaned, as
the basis of their system, some of the moral precepts
of the gospel, divested of the sublime sanctions
of Christianity. They soon, however, found
that it is not by flowers of rhetoric, and smooth-flowing
verses, and poetic rhapsodies upon the
beauty of love and charity, of rivulets and skies,
that the stern heart of man can be controlled.
Leviathan is not so tamed. Man, exposed to
temptations which rive his soul, trembling upon
the brink of fearful calamities, and glowing with
irrepressible desires, can only be allured and
overawed when the voice of love and mercy,
blends with Sinai's thunders. "There was frequently,"
says the Duchess of Abrantes, "so
much truth in the moral virtues which this new
sect inculcated, that if the Evangelists had not
said the same things much better, eighteen hundred
years before them, one might have been
tempted to embrace their opinions."</p>

<p>Napoleon took a correct view of these enthusiasts.
"They can accomplish nothing," said
he, "they are merely actors." "How!" it was
replied, "do you thus stigmatize those whose
tenets inculcate universal benevolence and the
moral virtues?" "All systems of morality,"
Napoleon rejoined, "are fine. The gospel alone
has exhibited a complete assemblage of the principles
of morality, divested of all absurdity. It
is not composed, like your creed, of a few common-place
sentences put into bad verse. Do
you wish to see that which is really sublime?
Repeat the Lord's Prayer. Such enthusiasts
are only to be encountered by the weapons of
ridicule. All their efforts will prove ineffectual."</p>

<p>Republican France was now at peace with all
the world, England alone excepted. The English
government still waged unrelenting war against
the Republic, and strained every nerve to rouse
the monarchies of Europe again to combine to
force a detested dynasty upon the French people.
The British navy, in its invincibility, had almost
annihilated the commerce of France. In their
ocean-guarded isle, safe from the ravages of war
themselves, their fleet could extend those ravages
to all shores. The Directory raised an army for
the invasion of England, and gave to Napoleon
the command. Drawing the sword, not of aggression
but of defense, he immediately proceeded
to a survey of the French coast, opposite to England,
and to form his judgment respecting the
feasibility of the majestic enterprise. Taking
three of his generals in his carriage, he passed
eight days in this tour of observation. With
great energy and tact he immediately made himself
familiar with every thing which could aid him
in coming to a decision. He surveyed the coast,
examined the ships and the fortifications, selected
the best points for embarkation, and examined
until midnight sailors, pilots, smugglers, and
fishermen. He made objections, and carefully
weighed their answers. Upon his return to Paris
his friend Bourrienne said to him, "Well, general!
what do you think of the enterprise? Is
it feasible?" "No!" he promptly replied, shaking
his head. "It is too hazardous. I will not
undertake it. I will not risk on such a stake the
fate of our beautiful France." At the same time
that he was making this survey of the coast, with
his accustomed energy of mind, he was also studying
another plan for resisting the assaults of
the British government. The idea of attacking
England, by the way of Egypt in her East Indian
acquisitions, had taken full possession of his imagination.
He filled his carriage with all the
books he could find in the libraries of Paris,
relating to Egypt. With almost miraculous
rapidity he explored the pages, treasuring up,
in his capacious and retentive memory, every
idea of importance. Interlineations and comments
on the margin of these books, in his own
hand-writing, testify to the indefatigable energy
of his mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon was now almost adored by the republicans
all over Europe, as the great champion
of popular rights. The people looked to him as
their friend and advocate. In England, in particular,
there was a large, influential, and increasing
party, dissatisfied with the prerogatives of the
crown, and with the exclusive privileges of the
nobility, who were never weary of proclaiming
the praises of this champion of liberty and equality.
The brilliance of his intellect, the purity of
his morals, the stoical firmness of his self-endurance,
his untiring energy, the glowing eloquence
of every sentence which fell from his lips, his
youth and feminine stature, and his wondrous
achievements, all combined to invest him with a
fascination such as no mortal man ever exerted
before. The command of the army for the invasion
of England was now assigned to Napoleon.
He became the prominent and dreaded foe of that
great empire. And yet the common people who
were to fight the battles almost to a man loved
him. The throne trembled. The nobles were
in consternation. "If we deal fairly and justly
with France," Lord Chatham is reported frankly
to have avowed, "the English government will
not exist for four-and-twenty hours." It was
necessary to change public sentiment and to rouse
feelings of personal animosity against this powerful
antagonist. To render Napoleon unpopular,
all the wealth and energies of the government
were called into requisition, opening upon him
the batteries of ceaseless invective. The English
press teemed with the most atrocious and absurd
abuse. It is truly amusing, in glancing over the
pamphlets of that day, to contemplate the enormity
of the vices attributed to him, and their contradictory
nature. He was represented as a perfect
demon in human form. He was a robber and
a miser, plundering the treasuries of nations that
he might hoard his countless millions, and he was
also a profligate and a spendthrift, squandering
upon his lusts the wealth of empires. He was
wallowing in licentiousness, his camp a harem
of pollution, ridding himself by poison of his
concubines as his vagrant desires wandered from
them; at the same time he was <i>physically an imbecile</i>&mdash;a
monster&mdash;whom God in his displeasure
had deprived of the passions and the powers of
healthy manhood. He was an idol whom the
entranced people bowed down before and worshiped,
with more than Oriental servility. He
was also a sanguinary heartless, merciless butcher,
exulting in carnage, grinding the bones of his
own wounded soldiers into the dust beneath his
chariot wheels, and finding congenial music for
his depraved and malignant spirit in the shrieks
of the mangled and the groans of the dying. To
Catholic Ireland he was represented as seizing
the venerable Pope by his gray hairs, and thus
dragging him over the marble floor of his palace.
To Protestant England, on the contrary, he was
exhibited as in league with the Pope, whom he
treated with the utmost adulation, endeavoring to
strengthen the despotism of the sword with the
energies of superstition.</p>

<p>The philosophical composure with which Napoleon
regarded this incessant flow of invective
was strikingly grand. "Of all the libels and
pamphlets," said Napoleon subsequently, "with
which the English ministers have inundated Europe,
there is not one which will reach posterity.
When I have been asked to cause answers to be
written to them, I have uniformly replied, 'My
victories and my works of public improvement
are the only response which it becomes me to
make.' When there shall not be a trace of these
libels to be found, the great monuments of utility
which I have reared, and the code of laws that I
have formed, will descend to the most remote ages,
and future historians will avenge the wrongs done
me by my contemporaries. There was a time,"
said he again, "when all crimes seemed to belong
to me of right; thus I poisoned Hoche,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I strangled
Pichegru<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in his cell, I caused Kleber<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to
be assassinated in Egypt, I blew out Desaix's<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
brains at Marengo, I cut the throats of persons
who were confined in prison, I dragged the Pope
by the hair of his head, and a hundred similar
absurdities. As yet," he again said, "I have not
seen one of those libels which is worthy of an
answer. Would you have me sit down and reply
to Goldsmith, Pichon, or the Quarterly Review?
They are so contemptible and so absurdly false,
that they do not merit any other notice, than to
write <i>false</i>, <i>false</i>, on every page. The only truth
I have seen in them is, that I one day met an
officer, General Rapp, I believe, on the field of
battle, with his face begrimed with smoke and
covered with blood, and that I exclaimed, 'Oh,
comme il est beau! <i>O, how beautiful the sight!</i>'
This is true enough. And of it they have made
a crime. My commendation of the gallantry of
a brave soldier, is construed into a proof of my
delighting in blood."</p>

<p>The revolutionary government were in the
habit of celebrating the 21st of January with
great public rejoicing, as the anniversary of the
execution of the king. They urged Napoleon to
honor the festival by his presence, and to take a
conspicuous part in the festivities. He peremptorily
declined. "This f&ecirc;te," said he, "commemorates
a melancholy event, a tragedy; and
can be agreeable to but few people. It is proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to celebrate victories; but victims left upon the
field of battle are to be lamented. To celebrate
the anniversary of a man's death is an act unworthy
of a government; it creates more enemies
than friends&mdash;it estranges instead of conciliating;
it irritates instead of calming; it shakes the
foundations of government instead of adding to
their strength." The ministry urged that it was
the custom with all nations to celebrate the downfall
of tyrants; and that Napoleon's influence
over the public mind was so powerful, that his
absence would be regarded as indicative of hostility
to the government, and would be highly
prejudicial to the interests of the Republic. At
last Napoleon consented to attend, as a private
member of the Institute, taking no active part in
the ceremonies, but merely walking with the
members of the class to which he belonged. As
soon as the procession entered the Church of St.
Sulpice, all eyes were searching for Napoleon.
He was soon descried, and every one else was
immediately eclipsed. At the close of the ceremony,
the air was rent with the shouts, "Long
live Napoleon!" The Directory were made exceedingly
uneasy by ominous exclamations in the
streets, "We will drive away these lawyers, and
make the <i>Little Corporal</i> king." These cries
wonderfully accelerated the zeal of the Directors,
in sending Napoleon to Egypt. And most devoutly
did they hope that from that distant land
he would never return.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>AN INDIAN PET.</h2>


<p>The ichneumon, called in India the neulah,
benjee, or mungoos, is known all over that
country. I have seen it on the banks of the
Ganges, and among the old walls of Jaunpore,
Sirhind, and at Loodianah; for, like others of
the weasel kind, this little animal delights in
places where it can lurk and peep&mdash;such as heaps
of stones and ruins; and there is no lack of these
in old Indian cities.</p>

<p>That the neulah is a fierce, terrible, blood-thirsty,
destructive little creature, I experienced
to my cost; but notwithstanding all the provocation
I received, I was led to become his
friend and protector, and so finding him out
to be the most charming and amiable pet in the
world.</p>

<p>In my military career (for I was for a long time
attached to the army) I was stationed at Jaunpore,
and having a house with many conveniences,
I took pleasure in rearing poultry; but scarcely
a single chicken could be magnified to a hen:
the rapacious neulahs, fond of tender meat, waylaying
all my young broods, sucking their blood,
and feasting on their brains. But such devastations
could not be allowed to pass with impunity;
so we watched the enemy, and succeeded in
shooting several of the offenders, prowling among
the hennah or mehendy hedges, where the clucking-hens
used to repose in the shade, surrounded
by their progeny.</p>

<p>After one of these <i>battues</i>, my little daughter
happened to go to the fowl-house in the evening
in search of eggs, and was greatly startled by a
melancholy squeaking which seemed to proceed
from an old rat-hole in one corner. Upon proper
investigation this was suspected to be the nest of
one of the neulahs which had suffered the last
sentence of the law; but how to get at the young
we did not know, unless by digging up the floor,
and of this I did not approve. So the little young
ones would have perished but for a childish freak
of my young daughter. She seated herself before
the nest, and imitated the cry of the famished
little animals so well, that three wee, hairless,
blind creatures crept out, like newly-born rabbits,
but with long tails, in the hope of meeting
with their lost mamma.</p>

<p>Our hearts immediately warmed toward the little
helpless ones, and no one wished to wreak the
sins of the parents upon the orphans; and knowing
that neulahs were reared as pets, I proposed
to my daughter that she should select one for
herself, and give the others to two of my servants.</p>

<p>My daughter's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, however, was the only
one that survived under its new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>; and
Jumnie, as she called her nursling, throve well,
and soon attained its full size, knowing its name,
and endearing itself to every body by its gambols
and tricks. She was like the most blithesome of
little kittens, and played with our fingers, and
frolicked on the sofas, sleeping occasionally behind
one of the cushions, and at other times
coiling herself up in her own little flannel
bed.</p>

<p>In the course of time, however, Jumnie grew
up to maturity, being one year old, and formed
an attachment for one of her own race&mdash;a wild,
roving bandit of a neulah, who committed such
deeds of atrocity in the fowl-house as to compel
us to take up arms again. If she had only made
her mistress the confidante of her love!&mdash;but,
alas! little did we suspect <i>our</i> neulah of a companionship
with thieves and assassins; and so
leaving her, we thought, to her customary frolics,
we marched upon the stronghold of the enemy.
Two neulahs appeared, we fired, and one fell,
the other running off unscathed. We all hastened
to the wounded and bleeding victim, and
my little daughter first of all; but how shall I
describe her grief when she saw her little Jumnie
writhing at her feet in the agonies of death!
If I had had the least idea of Jumnie's having
formed such an attachment, I should have spared
the guilty for the sake of the innocent, and Jumnie
might long have lived a favorite pet; but the
deed was done.</p>

<p>The neulahs, like other of the weasel kind&mdash;and
like some animals I know of a loftier species&mdash;are
very rapacious, slaying without reference
to their wants; and Jumnie, although fond of
milk, used to delight in livers and brains of fowls,
which she relished even after they were dressed
for our table.</p>

<p>The natives of India never molest the neulah.
They like to see it about their dwellings, on account
of its snake and rat-killing propensities;
and on a similar account it must have been that
this creature was deified by the Egyptians, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
country abounded with reptiles, and would have
been absolutely alive with crocodiles but for the
havoc it made among the numerous eggs, which
it delighted to suck. For this reason the ichneumons
were embalmed as public benefactors, and
their bodies are still found lying in state in some
of the pyramids. Among the Hindoos, however,
the neulah does not obtain quite such high honors,
although the elephant, monkey, lion, snake, rat,
goose, &amp;c., play a prominent part in the religious
myths, and are styled the B&acirc;hons, or vehicles of
the gods.</p>

<p>In Hindoostan the ichneumon is not supposed
to kill the crocodile, though it is in the mouth of
every old woman that it possesses the knowledge
of a remedy against the bite of a poisonous snake,
which its instinct leads it to dig out of the ground;
but this <i>on dit</i> has never been ascertained to be
true, and my belief is that it is only based on the
great agility and dexterity of the neulah. Eye-witnesses
say that his battles with man's greatest
enemy end generally in the death of the snake,
which the neulah seizes by the back of the neck,
and after frequent onsets at last kills and eats,
rejecting nothing but the head.</p>

<p>The color of the Indian neulah is a grayish-brown;
but its chief beauty lies in its splendid
squirrel-like tail, and lively, prominent, dark-brown
eyes. Like most of the weasel kind, however,
it has rather a disagreeable odor; and if it
were not for this there would not be a sweeter
pet in existence.</p>

<hr />

<p>So far the experience of an Old Indian; and
we now turn to another authority on the highly-curious
subject just glanced at&mdash;the knowledge
of the ichneumon of a specific against the poison
of the snake. Calder Campbell, in his recent
series of tales, "Winter Nights"&mdash;and capital
amusement for such nights they are&mdash;describes
in almost a painfully truthful manner the adventure
of an officer in India, who was an eye-witness,
under very extraordinary circumstances, to
the feat of the ichneumon. The officer, through
some accident, was wandering on foot, and at
night, through a desolate part of the country,
and at length, overcome with fatigue, threw himself
down on the dry, crisp spear-grass, and just
as the faint edge of the dawn appeared, fell
asleep.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it! I slept soundly, sweetly&mdash;no
doubt of it! I have never <i>since then</i> slept in
the open air either soundly or sweetly, for my
awaking was full of horror! Before I was fully
awake, however, I had a strange perception of
danger, which tied me down to the earth, warning
me against all motion. I knew that there
was a shadow creeping over me, beneath which
to lie in dumb inaction was the wisest resource.
I felt that my lower extremities were being invaded
by the heavy coils of a living chain; but
as if a providential opiate had been infused into
my system, preventing all movement of thew or
sinew, I knew not till I was wide awake that an
enormous serpent covered the whole of my nether
limbs, up to the knees!</p>

<p>"'My God! I am lost!' was the mental exclamation
I made, as every drop of blood in my
veins seemed turned to ice; and anon I shook
like an aspen leaf, until the very fear that my
sudden palsy might rouse the reptile, occasioned
a revulsion of feeling, and I again lay paralyzed.</p>

<p>"It slept, or at all events remained stirless; and
how long it so remained I know not, for time to the
fear-struck is as the ring of eternity. All at once
the sky cleared up&mdash;the moon shone out&mdash;the
stars glanced over me; I could see them all, as
I lay stretched on my side, one hand under my
head, whence I dared not remove it; neither
dared I looked downward at the loathsome bed-fellow
which my evil stars had sent me.</p>

<p>"Unexpectedly, a new object of terror supervened:
a curious purring sound behind me, followed
by two smart taps on the ground, put the
snake on the alert, for it moved, and I felt that
it was crawling upward to my breast. At that
moment, when I was almost maddened by insupportable
apprehension into starting up to meet,
perhaps, certain destruction, something sprang
upon my shoulder&mdash;upon the reptile! There was
a shrill cry from the new assailant, a loud, appalling
hiss from the serpent. For an instant I could
feel them wrestling, as it were, on my body; in
the next, they were beside me on the turf; in
another, a few paces off, struggling, twisting
round each other, fighting furiously, I beheld
them&mdash;a <i>mungoos</i> or ichneumon and a <i>cobra di
capello</i>!</p>

<p>"I started up; I watched that most singular
combat, for all was now clear as day. I saw
them stand aloof for a moment&mdash;the deep, venomous
fascination of the snaky glance powerless
against the keen, quick, restless orbs of its opponent:
I saw this duel of the eye exchange
once more for closer conflict: I saw that the
mungoos was bitten; that it darted away, doubtless
in search of that still unknown plant whose
juices are its alleged antidote against snake-bite;
that it returned with fresh vigor to the attack;
and then, glad sight! I saw the cobra di capello,
maimed from hooded head to scaly tail, fall lifeless
from its hitherto demi-erect position with a
baffled hiss; while the wonderful victor, indulging
itself in a series of leaps upon the body of
its antagonist, danced and bounded about, purring
and spitting like an enraged cat!</p>

<p>"Little graceful creature! I have ever since
kept a pet mungoos&mdash;the most attached, the most
playful, and the most frog-devouring of all animals."</p>

<hr />

<p>Many other authors refer to the alleged antidote
against a snake-bite, known only to the ichneumon,
and there are about as many different
opinions as there are authors; but, on the whole,
our Old Indian appears to us to be on the strongest
side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">KOSSUTH, AS GOVERNOR OF HUNGARY IN 1849.</span>
</div>

<p>Louis Kossuth<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> was born at Monok, in
Zemplin, one of the northern counties of
Hungary, on the 27th of April, 1806. His family
was ancient, but impoverished; his father served
in the Austrian army during the wars against
Napoleon; his mother, who still survives to exult
in the glory of her son, is represented to be
a woman of extraordinary force of mind and character.
Kossuth thus adds another to the long
list of great men who seem to have inherited
their genius from their mothers. As a boy he
was remarkable for the winning gentleness of
his disposition, and for an earnest enthusiasm,
which gave promise of future eminence, could he
but break the bonds imposed by low birth and
iron fortune. A young clergyman was attracted
by the character of the boy, and voluntarily took
upon himself the office of his tutor, and thus first
opened before his mind visions of a broader world
than that of the miserable village of his residence.
But these serene days of powers expanding under
genial guidance soon passed away. His father
died, his tutor was translated to another post,
and the walls of his prison-house seemed again
to close upon the boy. But by the aid of members
of his family, themselves in humble circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
he was enabled to attend such schools
as the district furnished. Little worth knowing
was taught there; but among that little was the
Latin language; and through that door the young
dreamer was introduced into the broad domains
of history, where, abandoning the mean present,
he could range at will through the immortal past.
History relates nothing so spirit-stirring as the
struggles of some bold patriot to overthrow or
resist arbitrary power. Hence the young student
of history is always a republican; but, unlike many
others, Kossuth never changed from that faith.</p>

<p>The annals of Hungary contain nothing so
brilliant as the series of desperate conflicts which
were waged at intervals for more than two centuries
to maintain the elective character of the
Hungarian monarchy, in opposition to the attempts
of the House of Austria to make the
crown hereditary in the Hapsburg line. In these
wars, from 1527 to 1715, seventeen of the family
of Kossuth had been attainted for high treason
against Austria. The last, most desperate, and
decisively unsuccessful struggle was that waged
by Rakozky, at the beginning of the last century.
Kossuth pored over the chronicles and annals
which narrate the incidents of this contest, till
he was master of all the minutest details. It
might then have been predicted that he would
one day write the history of that fruitless struggle,
and the biography of its hero; but no one
would have dared to prophesy that he would so
closely reproduce it in deeds.</p>

<p>In times of peace, the law offers to an aspiring
youth the readiest means of ascent from a low
degree to lofty stations. Kossuth, therefore, when
just entering upon manhood, made his way to
Pesth, the capital, to study the legal profession.
Here he entered the office of a notary, and began
gradually to make himself known by his liberal
opinions, and the fervid eloquence with which he
set forth and maintained them; and men began
to see in him the promise of a powerful public
writer, orator, and debater.</p>

<p>The man and the hour were alike preparing.
In 1825, the year before Kossuth arrived at Pesth,
the critical state of her Italian possessions compelled
Austria to provide extraordinary revenues.
The Hungarian Diet was then assembled, after
an interval of thirteen years. This Diet at once
demanded certain measures of reform before they
would make the desired pecuniary grants. The
court was obliged to concede these demands.
Kossuth, having completed his legal studies, and
finding no favorable opening in the capital, returned,
in 1830, to his native district, and commenced
the practice of the law, with marked
success. He also began to make his way toward
public life by his assiduous attendance and intelligent
action in the local assemblies. A new Diet
was assembled in 1832, and he received a commission
as the representative, in the Diet, of a
magnate who was absent. As proxy for an absentee,
he was only charged, by the Hungarian
Constitution, with a very subordinate part, his
functions being more those of a counsel than of
a delegate. This, however, was a post much
sought for by young and aspiring lawyers, as
giving them an opportunity of mastering legal
forms, displaying their abilities, and forming advantageous
connections.</p>

<p>This Diet renewed the Liberal struggle with
increased vigor. By far the best talent of Hungary
was ranged upon the Liberal side. Kossuth
early made himself known as a debater, and
gradually won his way upward, and became
associated with the leading men of the Liberal
party, many of whom were among the proudest
and richest of the Hungarian magnates. He
soon undertook to publish a report of the debates
and proceedings of the Diet. This attempt was
opposed by the Palatine, and a law hunted up
which forbade the "printing and publishing" of
these reports. He for a while evaded the law
by having his sheet lithographed. It increased
in its development of democratic tendencies, and
in popularity, until finally the lithographic press
was seized by Government. Kossuth, determined
not to be baffled, still issued his journal, every
copy being written out by scribes, of whom he
employed a large number. To avoid seizure at
the post-office, they were circulated through the
local authorities, who were almost invariably on
the Liberal side. This was a period of intense
activity on the part of Kossuth. He attended
the meetings of the Diet, and the conferences of
the deputies, edited his paper, read almost all
new works on politics and political economy, and
studied French and English for the sake of reading
the debates in the French Chambers and the
British Parliament; allowing himself, we are
told, but three hours' sleep in the twenty-four.
His periodical penetrated into every part of the
kingdom, and men saw with wonder a young and
almost unknown public writer boldly pitting himself
against Metternich and the whole Austrian
Cabinet. Kossuth might well, at this period
declare that he "felt within himself something
nameless."</p>

<p>In the succeeding Diets the Opposition grew
still more determined. Kossuth, though twice
admonished by Government, still continued his
journal; and no longer confined himself to simple
reports of the proceedings of the Diet, but
added political remarks of the keenest satire and
most bitter denunciation. He was aware that
his course was a perilous one. He was once
found by a friend walking in deep reverie in the
fortress of Buda, and in reply to a question as
to the subject of his meditations, he said, "I was
looking at the casemates, for I fear that I shall
soon be quartered there." Government finally
determined to use arguments more cogent than
discussion could furnish. Baron Wesselenyi,
the leader of the Liberal party, and the most
prominent advocate of the removal of urbarial
burdens, was arrested, together with a number
of his adherents. Kossuth was of course a person
of too much note to be overlooked, and on
the 4th of May, 1837, to use the words of an
Austrian partisan, "it happened that as he was
promenading in the vicinity of Buda, he was
seized by the myrmidons of the law, and confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in the lower walls of the fortress, there to consider,
in darkness and solitude, how dangerous it
is to defy a powerful government, and to swerve
from the path of law and of prudence."</p>

<p>Kossuth became at once sanctified in the popular
mind as a martyr. Liberal subscriptions
were raised through the country for the benefit
of his mother and sisters, whom he had supported
by his exertions, and who were now left without
protection. Wesselenyi became blind in prison;
Lovassi, an intimate friend of Kossuth, lost his
reason; and Kossuth himself, as was certified
by his physicians, was in imminent risk of falling
a victim to a serious disease. The rigor of his
confinement was mitigated; he was allowed
books, newspapers, and writing materials, and
suffered to walk daily upon the bastions of the
fortress, in charge of an officer. Among those
who were inspired with admiration for his political
efforts, and with sympathy for his fate, was
Teresa Mezlenyi, the young daughter of a nobleman.
She sent him books, and corresponded
with him during his imprisonment; and they
were married in 1841, soon after his liberation.</p>

<p>The action of the drama went on, though Kossuth
was for a while withdrawn from the stage.
His connection with Wesselenyi procured for him
a degree of influence among the higher magnates
which he could probably in no other way have
attained. Their aid was as essential to the early
success of the Liberals, as was the support of
Essex and Manchester to the Parliament of England
at the commencement of the contest with
Charles I.</p>

<p>In the second year of Kossuth's imprisonment,
Austria again needed Hungarian assistance.
The threatening aspect of affairs in the East,
growing out of the relations between Turkey
and Egypt, determined all the great powers to
increase their armaments. A demand was made
upon the Hungarian Diet for an additional levy
of 18,000 troops. A large body of delegates was
chosen pledged to oppose this grant except upon
condition of certain concessions, among which
was a general amnesty, with a special reference
to the cases of Wesselenyi and Kossuth. The
most sagacious of the Conservative party advised
Government to liberate all the prisoners, with the
exception of Kossuth; and to do this before the
meeting of the Diet, in order that their liberation
might not be made a condition of granting the
levy; which must be the occasion of great excitement.
The Cabinet temporized, and did nothing.
The Diet was opened, and the contest
was waged during six months. The Opposition
had a majority of two in the Chamber of Deputies,
but were in a meagre minority in the Chamber
of Magnates. But Metternich and the Cabinet
grew alarmed at the struggle, and were eager
to obtain the grant of men, and to close the refractory
Diet. In 1840 a royal rescript suddenly
made its appearance, granting the amnesty, accompanied
also with conciliatory remarks, and
the demands of the Government for men and
money were at once complied with. This action
of Government weakened the ranks of its supporters
among the Hungarian magnates, who
thus found themselves exposed to the charge of
being more despotic than the Cabinet of Metternich
itself.</p>

<p>Kossuth issued from prison in 1840, after an
imprisonment of three years, bearing in his debilitated
frame, his pallid face, and glassy eyes,
traces of severe sufferings, both of mind and
body. He repaired for a time to a watering-place
among the mountains to recruit his shattered
health. His imprisonment had done more
for his influence than he could have effected if
at liberty. The visitors at the watering-place
treated with silent respect the man who moved
about among them in dressing-gown and slippers,
and whose slow steps, and languid features
disfigured with yellow spots, proclaimed him an
invalid. Abundant subscriptions had been made
for his benefit and that of his family, and he now
stood on an equality with the proudest magnates.
These had so often used the name of the "Martyr
of the liberty of the press" in pointing their
speeches, that they now had no choice but to accept
the popular verdict as their own. Kossuth,
in the meanwhile mingled little with the society
at the watering-place; but preferred, as his
health improved, to wander among the forest-clad
hills and lonely valleys, where, says one
who there became acquainted with him, and was
his frequent companion, "the song of birds, a
group of trees, and even the most insignificant
phenomena of nature furnished occasions for
conversation." But now and then flashes would
burst forth which showed that he was revolving
other things in his mind. Sometimes a chord
would be casually struck which awoke deeper
feelings, then his rare eloquence would burst
forth with the fearful earnestness of conviction,
and he hurled forth sentences instinct with life
and passion. The wife of the Lord-Lieutenant,
the daughter of a great magnate, was attracted
by his appearance, and desired this companion
of Kossuth to introduce him to her house. When
this desire was made known to Kossuth, the
mysterious and nervous expression passed over
his face, which characterizes it when excited.
"No," he exclaimed, "I will not go to that woman's
house; her father subscribed four-pence
to buy a rope to hang me with!"</p>

<p>Soon after his liberation, he came forward as
the principal editor of the "Pesth Gazette"
(<i>Pesthi Hirlap</i>), which a bookseller, who enjoyed
the protection of the Government, had received
permission to establish. The name of the editor
was now sufficient to electrify the country; and
Kossuth at once stood forth as the advocate of
the rights of the lower and middle classes against
the inordinate privileges and immunities enjoyed
by the magnates. But when he went to the extent
of demanding that the house-tax should be
paid by all classes in the community, not even
excepting the highest nobility, a party was raised
up against him among the nobles, who established
a paper to combat so disorganizing a doctrine.
This party, backed by the influence of
Government, succeeded in defeating the election<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of Kossuth as member from Pesth for the Diet
of 1843. He was, however, very active in the
local Assembly of the capital.</p>

<p>Kossuth was not altogether without support
among the higher nobles. The blind old Wesselenyi
traversed the country, advocating rural
freedom and the abolition of the urbarial burdens.
Among his supporters at this period also,
was Count Louis Batthyanyi, one of the most
considerable of the Magyar magnates, subsequently
President of the Hungarian Ministry,
and the most illustrious martyr of the Hungarian
cause. Aided by his powerful support, Kossuth
was again brought forward, in 1847, as one of the
two candidates from Pesth. The Government
party, aware that they were in a decided minority,
limited their efforts to an attempt to defeat the
election of Kossuth. This they endeavored to
effect by stratagem. The Liberal party nominated
Szentkiraly and Kossuth. The Government
party also named the former. The Royal
Administrator, who presided at the election, decided
that Szentkiraly was chosen by acclamation;
but that a poll must be held for the other
member. Before the intention of Kossuth to
present himself as a candidate was known, the
Liberals had proposed M. Balla as second delegate.
He at once resigned in favor of Kossuth.
The Government party cast their votes for him,
in hopes of drawing off a portion of the Liberal
party from the support of Kossuth. M. Balla
loudly but unavailingly protested against this
stratagem; and when after a scrutiny of twelve
hours, Kossuth was declared elected, Balla was
the first to applaud. That night Kossuth, Balla,
and Szentkiraly were serenaded by the citizens
of Pesth; they descended together to the street,
and walked arm-in-arm among the crowd. The
Royal Administrator was severely reprimanded
for not having found means to prevent the election
of Kossuth.</p>

<p>Kossuth no sooner took his seat in the Diet
than the foremost place was at once conceded to
him. At the opening of the session he moved
an address to the king, concluding with the petition
that "liberal institutions, similar to those
of the Hungarian Constitution, might be accorded
to all the hereditary states, that thus might
be created a united Austrian monarchy, based
upon broad and constitutional principles." During
the early months of the session Kossuth
showed himself a most accomplished parliamentary
orator and debater; and carried on a series
of attacks upon the policy of the Austrian Cabinet,
which for skill and power have few parallels
in the annals of parliamentary warfare. Those
form a very inadequate conception of its scope
and power, whose ideas of the eloquence of Kossuth
are derived solely from the impassioned and
exclamatory harangues which he flung out during
the war. These were addressed to men wrought
up to the utmost tension, and can be judged fairly
only by men in a state of high excitement.
He adapted his matter and manner to the occasion
and the audience. Some of his speeches
are marked by a stringency of logic worthy of
Webster or Calhoun:&mdash;but it was what all eloquence
of a high order must ever be&mdash;"Logic
red-hot."</p>

<p>Now came the French Revolution of February,
1848. The news of it reached Vienna on the
1st of March, and was received at Pressburg on
the 2d. On the following day Kossuth delivered
his famous speech on the finances and the state
of the monarchy generally, concluding with a proposed
"Address to the Throne," urging a series
of reformatory measures. Among the foremost
of these was the emancipation of the country
from feudal burdens&mdash;the proprietors of the soil
to be indemnified by the state; equalizing taxation;
a faithful administration of the revenue to
be satisfactorily guaranteed; the further development
of the representative system; and the establishment
of a government representing the voice
of, and responsible to the nation.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The speech
produced an effect almost without parallel in the
annals of debate. Not a word was uttered in
reply, and the motion was unanimously carried.
On the 13th of March took place the revolution
in Vienna which overthrew the Metternich Cabinet.
On the 15th, the Constitution granted by
the Emperor to all the nations within the Empire
was solemnly proclaimed, amidst the wildest
transports of joy. Henceforth there were to
be no more Germans or Sclavonians, Magyars or
Italians; strangers embraced and kissed each
other in the streets, for all the heterogeneous
races of the Empire were now brothers:&mdash;as likewise
were all the nations of the earth at Anacharsis
Klootz's "Feast of Pikes" in Paris, on
that 14th day of July in the year of grace 1790&mdash;and
yet, notwithstanding, came the "Reign of
Terror."</p>

<p>Among the demands made by the Hungarian
Diet was that of a separate and responsible Ministry
for Hungary. The Palatine, Archduke
Stephen, to whom the conduct of affairs in Hungary
had been intrusted, persuaded the Emperor
to accede to this demand, and on the following
day Batthyanyi, who with Kossuth and a deputation
of delegates of the Diet was in Vienna,
was named President of the Hungarian Ministry.
It was, however, understood that Kossuth was
the life and soul of the new Ministry.</p>

<p>Kossuth assumed the department of Finance,
then, as long before and now, the post of difficulty
under Austrian administration. The Diet
meanwhile went on to consummate the series of
reforms which Kossuth had so long and steadfastly
advocated. The remnants of feudalism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
were swept away&mdash;the landed proprietors being
indemnified by the state for the loss they sustained.
The civil and political rights which had
heretofore been in the exclusive possession of
the nobles, were extended to the burghers and
the peasants. A new electoral law was framed,
according the right of suffrage to every possessor
of property to the amount of about one hundred
and fifty dollars. The whole series of bills received
the royal signature on the 11th of April;
the Diet having previously adjourned to meet on
the 2d of July.</p>

<p>Up to this time there had been indeed a vigorous
and decided opposition, but no insurrection.
The true cause of the Hungarian war was the
hostility of the Austrian Government to the whole
series of reformatory measures which had been
effected through the instrumentality of Kossuth;
but its immediate occasion was the jealousy
which sprung up among the Serbian and Croatian
dependencies of Hungary against the Hungarian
Ministry. This soon broke out into an
open revolt, headed by Baron Jellachich, who had
just been appointed Ban or Lord of Croatia. How
far the Serbs and Croats had occasion for jealousy,
is of little consequence to our present
purpose to inquire; though we may say, in passing,
that the proceedings of the Magyars toward
the other Hungarian races was marked by a far
more just and generous feeling and conduct than
could have been possibly expected; and that the
whole ground of hostility was sheer misrepresentation;
and this, if we may credit the latest
and best authorities, is now admitted by the
Sclavic races themselves. But however the case
may have been as between the Magyars and
Croats, as between the Hungarians and Austria,
the hostile course of the latter is without excuse
or palliation. The Emperor had solemnly sanctioned
the action of the Diet, and did as solemnly
denounce the proceedings of Jellachich. On the
29th of May the Ban was summoned to present
himself at Innspruck, to answer for his conduct;
and as he did not make his appearance, an Imperial
manifesto was issued on the 10th of June, depriving
him of all his dignities, and commanding
the authorities at once to break off all intercourse
with him. He, however, still continued his operations,
and levied an army for the invasion of
Hungary, and a fierce and bloody war of races
broke out, marked on both sides by the most
fearful atrocities.</p>

<p>The Hungarian Diet was opened on the 5th
of July, when the Palatine, Archduke Stephen,
in the name of the king, solemnly denounced the
conduct of the insurgent Croats. A few days
after, Kossuth, in a speech in the Diet, set forth
the perilous state of affairs, and concluded by asking
for authority to raise an army of 200,000 men,
and a large amount of money. These proposals
were adopted by acclamation, the enthusiasm in
the Diet rendering any debate impossible and
superfluous.</p>

<p>The Imperial forces having been victorious in
Italy, and one pressing danger being thus averted
from the Empire, the Austrian Cabinet began
openly to display its hostility to the Hungarian
movement. Jellachich repaired to Innspruck,
and was openly acknowledged by the court, and
the decree of deposition was revoked. Early in
September Hungary and Austria stood in an attitude
of undisguised hostility. On the 5th of
that month, Kossuth, though enfeebled by illness,
was carried to the hall of the Diet where he delivered
a speech, declaring that so formidable
were the dangers that surrounded the nation,
that the Ministers might soon be forced to call
upon the Diet to name a Dictator, clothed with
unlimited powers, to save the country; but before
taking this final step they would recommend
a last appeal to the Imperial government. A
large deputation was thereupon dispatched to
the Emperor, to lay before him the demands of
the Hungarian nation. No satisfactory answer
was returned, and the deputation left the Imperial
presence in silence. On their return, they
plucked from their caps the plumes of the united
colors of Austria and Hungary, and replaced
them with red feathers, and hoisted a flag of the
same color on the steamer which conveyed them
to Pesth. Their report produced the most intense
agitation in the Diet, and at the capital, but
it was finally resolved to make one more attempt
for a pacific settlement of the question. In order
that no obstacle might be interposed by their
presence, Kossuth and his colleagues resigned,
and a new Ministry was appointed. A deputation
was sent to the National Assembly at Vienna,
which refused to receive it. Jellachich
had in the mean time entered Hungary with a
large army, not as yet, however, openly sanctioned
by Imperial authority. The Diet seeing
the imminent peril of the country, conferred dictatorial
powers upon Kossuth. The Palatine
resigned his post, and left the kingdom. The
Emperor appointed Count Lemberg to take the
entire command of the Hungarian army. The
Diet declared the appointment illegal, and the
Count, arriving at Pesth without escort, was
slain in the streets of the capital by the populace,
in a sudden outbreak. The Emperor forthwith
placed the kingdom under martial law,
giving the supreme civil and military power to
Jellachich. The Diet at once revolted; declared
itself permanent, and appointed Kossuth Governor,
and President of the Committee of Safety.</p>

<p>There was now but one course left for the
Hungarians: to maintain by force of arms the
position they had assumed. We can not detail
the events of the war which followed, but merely
touch upon the most salient points. Jellachich
was speedily driven out of Hungary, toward
Vienna. In October, the Austrian forces were
concentrated under command of Windischgr&auml;tz,
to the number of 120,000 veterans, and were put
on the march for Hungary. To oppose them, the
only forces under the command of the new Government
of Hungary, were 20,000 regular infantry,
7000 cavalry, and 14,000 recruits, who
received the name of Honveds, or "protectors
of home." Of all the movements that followed,
Kossuth was the soul and chief. His burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and passionate appeals stirred up the souls of
the peasants, and sent them by thousands to the
camp. He kindled enthusiasm, he organized
that enthusiasm, and transformed those raw recruits
into soldiers more than a match for the
veteran troops of Austria. Though himself not
a soldier, he discovered and drew about him
soldiers and generals of a high order. The result
was that Windischgr&auml;tz was driven back
from Hungary, and of the 120,000 troops which
he led into that kingdom in October, one half
were killed, disabled, or taken prisoners at the
end of April. The state of the war on the 1st
of May, may be gathered from the Imperial manifesto
of that date, which announced that "the
insurrection in Hungary had grown to such an
extent," that the Imperial Government "had
been induced to appeal to the assistance of his
Majesty the Czar of all the Russias, who generously
and readily granted it to a most satisfactory
extent." The issue of the contest could no longer
be doubtful, when the immense weight of Russia
was thrown into the scale. Had all power,
civil and military been concentrated in one person,
and had he displayed the brilliant generalship
and desperate courage which Napoleon
manifested in 1814, when the overwhelming
forces of the allies were marching upon Paris,
the fall of Hungary might have been delayed for
a few weeks, perhaps to another campaign; but
it could not have been averted. In modern warfare
there is a limit beyond which devotion and
enthusiasm can not supply the place of numbers
and material force. And that limit was overpassed
when Russia and Austria were pitted
against Hungary.</p>

<p>The chronology of the Hungarian struggle
may be thus stated: On the 9th of September,
1848, Jellachich crossed the Drave and invaded
Hungary; and was driven back at the close of
that month toward Vienna. In October, Windischgr&auml;tz
advanced into Hungary, and took
possession of Pesth, the capital. On the 14th
of April, 1849, the Declaration of Hungarian
Independence was promulgated. At the close
of that month, the Austrians were driven out at
every point, and the issue of the contest, as between
Hungary and Austria, was settled. On
the 1st of May the Russian intervention was
announced. On the 11th of August Kossuth
resigned his dictatorship into the hands of G&ouml;rgey
who, two days after, in effect closed the war
by surrendering to the Russians.</p>

<p>The Hungarian war thus lasted a little more
than eleven months; during which time there
was but one ruling and directing spirit; and
that was Kossuth, to whose immediate career
we now return.</p>

<p>Early in January it was found advisable to
remove the seat of government from Pesth to
the town of Debreczin, situated in the interior.
Pesth was altogether indefensible, and the Austrian
army were close upon it; but here the Hungarians
had collected a vast amount of stores and
ammunition, the preservation of which was of the
utmost importance. In saving these the administrative
power of Kossuth was strikingly manifested.
For three days and three nights he labored
uninterruptedly in superintending the removal,
which was successfully effected. From
the heaviest locomotive engine down to a shot-belt,
all the stores were packed up and carried
away, so that when the Austrians took possession
of Pesth, they only gained the eclat of occupying
the Hungarian capital, without acquiring
the least solid advantage.</p>

<p>Debreczin was the scene where Kossuth displayed
his transcendent abilities as an administrator,
a statesman, and an orator. The population
of the town was about 50,000, which was at
once almost doubled, so that every one was forced
to put up with such accommodations as he could
find, and occupy the least possible amount of
space. Kossuth himself occupied the Town Hall.
On the first floor was a spacious ante-room, constantly
filled with persons waiting for an interview,
which was, necessarily, a matter of delay,
as each one was admitted in his turn; the only
exception being in cases where public business
required an immediate audience.</p>

<p>This ante-room opened into two spacious apartments,
in one of which the secretaries of the Governor
were always at work. Here Kossuth received
strangers. At these audiences he spoke
but little, but listened attentively, occasionally
taking notes of any thing that seemed of importance.
His secretaries were continually coming
to him to receive directions, to present a report, or
some document to receive his signature. These
he never omitted to examine carefully, before affixing
his signature, even amidst the greatest
pressure of business; at the same time listening
to the speaker. "Be brief," he used to say, "but
for that very reason forget nothing." These
hours of audience were also his hours of work,
and here it was that he wrote those stirring appeals
which aroused and kept alive the spirit of
his countrymen. It was only when he had some
document of extraordinary importance to prepare,
that he retired to his closet. These audiences
usually continued until far into the night, the ante-room
being often as full at midnight as in the
morning. Although of a delicate constitution,
broken also by his imprisonment, the excitement
bore him up under the immense mental and bodily
exertion, and while there was work to do he
was never ill.</p>

<p>He usually allowed himself an hour for rest or
relaxation, from two till three o'clock, when he
was accustomed to take a drive with his wife and
children to a little wood at a short distance, where
he would seek out some retired spot, and play
upon the grass with his children, and for a moment
forget the pressing cares of state.</p>

<p>At three o'clock he dined; and at the conclusion
of his simple meal, was again at his post.
This round of audiences was frequently interrupted
by a council of war, a conference of ministers,
or the review of a regiment just on the
point of setting out for the seat of hostilities.
New battalions seemed to spring from the earth
at his command, and he made a point of reviewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
each, and delivering to them a brief address,
which was always received with a burst of
"<i>eljens</i>."</p>

<p>At Debreczin the sittings of the House of Assembly
were held in what had been the chapel
of the Protestant College. Kossuth attended
these sittings only when he had some important
communications to make. Then he always
walked over from the Town Hall. Entering the
Assembly, he ascended the rostrum, if it was not
occupied; if it was, he took his place in any vacant
seat, none being specially set apart for the
Governor. He was a monarch, but with an invisible
throne, the hearts of his subjects. When
the rostrum was vacant, he would ascend it, and
lay before the Assembly his propositions, or sway
all hearts by his burning and fervent eloquence.</p>

<p>Such was the daily life of Kossuth at the temporary
seat of government, bearing upon his
shoulders the affairs of state, calling up, as if by
magic, regiment after regiment, providing for
their arming, equipment, and maintenance, while
the Hungarian generals were contending on the
field, with various fortunes; triumphantly against
the Austrians, desperately and hopelessly when
Russia was added to the enemy.</p>

<p>The defeat of Bem at Temesvar, on the 9th of
August gave the death-blow to the cause. Two
days afterward, Kossuth and G&ouml;rgey stood alone
in the bow-window of a small chamber in the
fortress of Arad. What passed between them
no man knows; but from that room G&ouml;rgey went
forth Dictator of Hungary; and Kossuth followed
him to set out on his journey of exile. On the
same day the new Dictator announced to the
Russians his intention to surrender the forces
under his command. The following day he
marched to the place designated, where the Russian
General Rudiger arrived on the 13th, and
G&ouml;rgey's army, numbering 24,000 men, with 144
pieces of artillery, laid down their arms.</p>

<p>Nothing remained for Kossuth and his companions
but flight. They gained the Turkish
frontier, and threw themselves on the hospitality
of the Sultan, who promised them a safe asylum.
Russia and Austria demanded that the fugitives
should be given up; and for some months it was
uncertain whether the Turkish Government would
dare to refuse. At first a decided negative was
returned; then the Porte wavered; and it was
officially announced to Kossuth and his companions
that the only means for them to avoid
surrendry would be to abjure the faith of their
fathers; and thus take advantage of the fundamental
Moslem law, that any fugitive embracing
the Mohammedan faith can claim the protection
of the Government. Kossuth refused to purchase
his life at such a price. And finally Austria
and Russia were induced to modify their
demand, and merely to insist upon the detention
of the fugitives. On the other hand, the Turkish
Government was urged to allow them to depart.
Early in the present year, Mr. Webster,
as Secretary of State, directed our Minister at
Constantinople to urge the Porte to suffer the
exiles to come to the United States. A similar
course was pursued by the British Government.
It was promised that these representations should
be complied with; but so late as in March of the
present year, Kossuth addressed a letter to our
Charg&eacute; at Constantinople, despairing of his release
being granted. But happily his fears were
groundless; and our Government was notified
that on the 1st of September, the day on which
terminated the period of detention agreed upon
by the Sultan, Kossuth and his companions would
be free to depart to any part of the world. The
United States steam-frigate Mississippi, was at
once placed at his disposal. The offer was accepted.
On the 12th of September the steamer
reached Smyrna, with the illustrious exile and
his family and suite on board, bound to our shores,
after a short visit in England. The Government
of France, in the meanwhile, denied him the privilege
of passing through their territory. While
this sheet is passing through the press, we are
in daily expectation of the arrival of Kossuth in
our country, where a welcome awaits him warmer
and more enthusiastic than has greeted any
man who has ever approached our shores, saving
only the time when <span class="smcap">La Fayette</span> was our nation's
honored guest.</p>

<p>It is right and fitting that it should be so.
When a monarch is dethroned it is appropriate
that neighboring monarchies should accord a
hearty and hospitable reception to him, as the
representative of the monarchical principle, even
though his own personal character should present
no claims upon esteem or regard. Kossuth comes
to us as the exiled representative of those fundamental
principles upon which our political institutions
are based. He is the representative of
these principles, not by the accident of birth, but
by deliberate choice. He has maintained them
at a fearful hazard. It is therefore our duty and
our privilege to greet him with a hearty, "Well
done!"</p>

<p>Kossuth occupies a position peculiarly his own,
whether we regard the circumstances of his rise,
or the feelings which have followed him in his
fall. Born in the middle ranks of life, he raised
himself by sheer force of intellect to the loftiest
place among the proudest nobles on earth, without
ever deserting or being deserted by the class
from which he sprung. He effected a sweeping
reform without appealing to any sordid or sanguinary
motive. No soldier himself, he transformed
a country into a camp, and a nation into
an army. He transmuted his words into batteries,
and his thoughts into soldiers. Without
ever having looked upon a stricken field, he organized
the most complete system of resistance
to despotism that the history of revolutions has
furnished. It failed, but only failed where nothing
could have succeeded.</p>

<p>Not less peculiar are the feelings which have
followed him in his fall. Men who have saved
a state have received the unbounded love and
gratitude of their countrymen. Those who have
fallen in the lost battle for popular rights, or who
have sealed their devotion on the scaffold or in
the dungeon, are reverenced as martyrs forevermore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
But Kossuth's endeavors have been sanctified
and hallowed neither by success nor by
martyrdom. He is the living leader of a lost
cause. His country is ruined, its nationality destroyed,
and through his efforts. Yet no Hungarian
lays this ruin to his charge; and the first
lesson taught the infant Magyar is a blessing
upon his name. Yet whatever the future may
have in store, his efforts have not been lost
efforts. The tree which he planted in blood and
agony and tears, though its tender shoots have
been trampled down by the Russian bear, will
yet spring up again to gladden, if not his heart,
yet those of his children or his children's children.
The man may perish, but the cause endures.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE LEGEND OF THE LOST WELL.</h2>


<p>In ancient times there existed in the desert
that lies to the west of Egypt&mdash;somewhere
between the sun at its setting and the city of
Siout&mdash;a tribe of Arabs that called themselves
Waled Allah, or The Children of God. They
professed Mohammedanism, but were in every
other respect different from their neighbors to
the north and south, and from the inhabitants of
the land of Egypt. It was their custom during
the months of summer to draw near to the confines
of the cultivated country and hold intercourse
with its people, selling camels and wool,
and other desert productions; but when winter
came they drew off toward the interior of the
wilderness, and it was not known where they
abode. They were by no means great in numbers;
but such was their skill in arms, and their
reputation for courage, that no tribe ever ventured
to trespass on their limits, and all caravans
eagerly paid to them the tribute of safe-conduct.</p>

<p>Such was the case for many years; but at
length it came to pass that the Waled Allah,
after departing as usual for the winter, returned
in great disorder and distress toward the neighborhood
of the Nile. Those who saw them on
that occasion reported that their sufferings must
have been tremendous. More than two-thirds
of their cattle, a great number of the women and
children, and several of the less hardy men, were
missing; but they would not at first confess what
had happened to them. When, however, they
asked permission to settle temporarily on some
unoccupied lands, the curious and inquisitive went
among them, and by degrees the truth came
out.</p>

<p>It appeared that many centuries ago one of
their tribe, following the track of some camels
that had strayed, had ventured to a great distance
in the desert, and had discovered a pass in
the mountains leading into a spacious valley, in
the midst of which was a well of the purest water,
that overflowed and fertilized the land around.
As the man at once understood the importance of
his discovery, he devoted himself for his tribe, and
returned slowly, piling up stones here and there
that the way might not again be lost. When
he arrived at the station he had only sufficient
strength to relate what he had seen before he
died of fatigue and thirst. So they called the
well after him&mdash;Bir Hassan.</p>

<p>It was found that the valley was only habitable
during the winter; for being surrounded
with perpendicular rocks it became like a furnace
in the hot season&mdash;the vegetation withered
into dust, and the waters hid themselves within
the bowels of the earth. They resolved, therefore,
to spend one half of their time in that spot,
where they built a city; and during the other
half of their time they dwelt, as I have said, on
the confines of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>But it was found that only by a miracle had
the well of Hassan been discovered. Those who
tried without the aid of the road-marks to make
their way to it invariably failed. So it became
an institution of the tribe that two men should
be left, with a sufficient supply of water and
food, in a large cave overlooking the desert near
the entrance of the valley; and that they should
watch for the coming of the tribe, and when a
great fire was lighted on a certain hill, should
answer by another fire, and thus guide their
people. This being settled, the piles of stones
were dispersed, lest the greedy Egyptians, hearing
by chance of this valley, should make their
way to it.</p>

<p>How long matters continued in this state is
not recorded, but at length, when the tribe set
out to return to their winter quarters, and reached
the accustomed station and lighted the fire,
no answering fire appeared. They passed the
first night in expectation, and the next day, and
the next night, saying: "Probably the men are
negligent;" but at length they began to despair.
They had brought but just sufficient water with
them for the journey, and death began to menace
them. In vain they endeavored to find the road.
A retreat became necessary; and, as I have said,
they returned and settled on the borders of the
land of Egypt. Many men, however, went back
many times year after year to endeavor to find
the lost well; but some were never heard of
more, and some returned, saying that the search
was in vain.</p>

<p>Nearly a hundred years passed away, and the
well became forgotten, and the condition of the
tribe had undergone a sad change. It never recovered
its great disaster: wealth and courage
disappeared; and the governors of Egypt, seeing
the people dependent and humble-spirited, began,
as is their wont, to oppress them, and lay on
taxes and insults. Many times a bold man of
their number would propose that they should go
and join some of the other tribes of Arabs, and
solicit to be incorporated with them; but the idea
was laughed at as extravagant, and they continued
to live on in misery and degradation.</p>

<p>It happened that the chief of the tribe at the
time of which I now speak was a man of gentle
character and meek disposition, named Abdallah
the Good, and that he had a son, like one of the
olden time, stout, and brave as a lion, named
Ali. This youth could not brook the subjection
in which his people were kept, nor the wrongs
daily heaped upon them, and was constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
revolving in his mind the means of escape and
revenge. When he gave utterance to these sentiments,
however, his father, Abdallah, severely rebuked
him; for he feared the power of the
lords of Egypt, and dreaded lest mischief might
befall his family or his tribe.</p>

<p>Now contemporary with Abdallah the Good
there was a governor of Siout named Omar the
Evil. He had gained a great reputation in the
country by his cruelties and oppressions, and
was feared by high and low. Several times had
he treated the Waled Allah with violence and
indignity, bestowing upon them the name of
Waled Sheitan, or Children of the Devil, and
otherwise vexing and annoying them, besides
levying heavy tribute, and punishing with extreme
severity the slightest offense. One day
he happened to be riding along in the neighborhood
of their encampment when he observed Ali
trying the paces of a handsome horse which he
had purchased. Covetousness entered his mind,
and calling to the youth, he said, "What is the
price of thy horse?"</p>

<p>"It is not for sale," was the reply.</p>

<p>No sooner were the words uttered than Omar
made a signal to his men, who rushed forward,
threw the young man to the ground in spite of
his resistance, and leaving him there, returned
leading the horse. Omar commanded them to
bring it with them, and rode away, laughing
heartily at his exploit.</p>

<p>But Ali was not the man to submit tamely to
such injustice. He endeavored at first to rouse
the passions of his tribe, but not succeeding, resolved
to revenge himself or die in the attempt.
One night, therefore, he took a sharp dagger,
disguised himself, and lurking about the governor's
palace, contrived to introduce himself without
being seen, and to reach the garden, where
he had heard it was the custom of Omar to repose
awhile as he waited for his supper. A
light guided him to the kiosque where the tyrant
slept alone, not knowing that vengeance was
nigh. Ali paused a moment, doubting whether
it was just to strike an unprepared foe; but he
remembered all his tribe had suffered as well as
himself, and raising his dagger, advanced stealthily
toward the couch where the huge form of the
governor lay.</p>

<p>A slight figure suddenly interposed between
him and the sleeping man. It was that of a
young girl, who, with terror in her looks, waved
him back. "What wouldst thou, youth?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"I come to slay that enemy," replied Ali,
endeavoring to pass her and effect his purpose
while there was yet time.</p>

<p>"It is my father," said she, still standing in
the way and awing him by the power of her
beauty.</p>

<p>"Thy father is a tyrant, and deserves to
die."</p>

<p>"If he be a tyrant he is still my father; and
thou, why shouldst thou condemn him?"</p>

<p>"He has injured me and my tribe."</p>

<p>"Let injuries be forgiven, as we are commanded.
I will speak for thee and thy tribe. Is not
thy life valuable to thee? Retire ere it be too
late; and by my mother, who is dead, I swear
to thee that I will cause justice to be done."</p>

<p>"Not from any hopes of justice, but as a
homage to God for having created such marvelous
beauty, do I retire and spare the life of that
man which I hold in my hands."</p>

<p>So saying Ali sprang away, and effected his
escape. No sooner was he out of sight than
Omar, who had been awakened by the sound of
voices, but who had feigned sleep when he
heard what turn affairs were taking, arose and
laughed, saying: "Well done, Amina! thou art
worthy of thy father. How thou didst cajole
that son of a dog by false promises?"</p>

<p>"Nay, father; what I have promised must be
performed."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay. Thou didst promise justice, and,
by the beards of my ancestors, justice shall assuredly
be done!"</p>

<p>Next day Ali was seized and conducted to
the prison adjoining the governor's palace. Amina,
when she heard of this, in vain sought to
obtain his release. Her father laughed at her
scruples, and avowed his intention of putting
the young man to death in the cruelest possible
manner. He had him brought before him, bound
and manacled, and amused himself by reviling
and taunting him&mdash;calling him a fool for having
yielded to the persuasions of a foolish girl! Ali,
in spite of all, did not reply; for he now thought
more of Amina than of the indignities to which
he was subjected; and instead of replying with
imprudent courage, as under other circumstances
he might have done, he took care not to exasperate
the tyrant, and meanwhile revolved in his
mind the means of escape. If he expected that
his mildness would disarm the fury of Omar,
never was mistake greater; for almost in the
same breath with the order for his being conducted
back to prison was given that for public
proclamation of his execution to take place on
the next day.</p>

<p>There came, however, a saviour during the
night: it was the young Amina, who, partly
moved by generous indignation that her word
should have been given in vain, partly by another
feeling, bribed the jailers, and leading forth the
young man, placed him by the side of his trusty
steed which had been stolen from him, and bade
him fly for his life. He lingered to thank her
and enjoy her society. They talked long and
more and more confidentially. At length the
first streaks of dawn began to show themselves;
and Amina, as she urged him to begone, clung
to the skirts of his garments. He hesitated a
moment, a few hurried words passed, and presently
she was behind him on the horse, clasping
his waist, and away they went toward the mountains,
into the midst of which they soon penetrated
by a rugged defile.</p>

<p>Amina had been prudent enough to prepare a
small supply of provisions, and Ali knew where
at that season water was to be found in small
quantities. His intention was to penetrate to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
certain distance in the desert, and then turning
south, to seek the encampment of a tribe with
some of whose members he was acquainted.
Their prospects were not very discouraging; for
even if pursuit were attempted, Ali justly confided
in his superior knowledge of the desert:
he expected in five days to reach the tents toward
which he directed his course, and he calculated
that the small bag of flour which Amina
had provided would prevent them at least from
dying of hunger during that time.</p>

<p>The first stage was a long one. For seven
hours he proceeded in a direct line from the
rising sun, the uncomplaining Amina clinging
still to him; but at length the horse began to
exhibit symptoms of fatigue, and its male rider
of anxiety. They had traversed an almost uninterrupted
succession of rocky valleys, but now
reached an elevated undulating plain covered with
huge black boulders that seemed to stretch like
a petrified sea to the distant horizon. Now and
then they had seen during their morning's ride,
in certain little sheltered nooks, small patches of
a stunted vegetation; but now all was bleak and
barren, and grim like the crater of a volcano.
And yet it was here that Ali expected evidently
to find water&mdash;most necessary to them; for all
three were feeling the symptoms of burning
thirst. He paused every now and then, checking
his steed, and rising in his stirrups to gaze
ahead or on one side; but each time his search
was in vain. At length he said: "Possibly I
have, in the hurry of my thoughts, taken the
wrong defile, in which case nothing but death
awaits us. We shall not have strength to retrace
our footsteps, and must die here in this horrible
place. Stand upon the saddlebow, Amina,
while I support thee: if thou seest any thing
like a white shining cloud upon the ground, we
are saved."</p>

<p>Amina did as she was told, and gazed for a
few moments around. Suddenly she cried: "I
see, as it were a mist of silver far, far away to
the left."</p>

<p>"It is the first well," replied Ali; and he
urged his stumbling steed in that direction.</p>

<p>It soon appeared that they were approaching
a mound of dazzling whiteness. Close by was
a little hollow, apparently dry. But Ali soon
scraped away a quantity of the clayey earth, and
presently the water began to collect, trickling in
from the sides. In a couple of hours they procured
enough for themselves and for the horse,
and ate some flour diluted in a wooden bowl;
after which they lay down to rest beneath a
ledge of rock that threw a little shade. Toward
evening, after Ali had carefully choked up the
well, lest it might be dried by the sun, they resumed
their journey, and arrived about midnight
at a lofty rock in the midst of the plain, visible
at a distance of many hours in the moonlight.
In a crevice near the summit of this they found
a fair supply of water, and having refreshed
themselves, reposed until dawn. Then Amina
prepared their simple meal, and soon afterward
off they went again over the burning plain.</p>

<p>This time, as Ali knew beforehand, there was
no prospect of well or water for twenty-four
hours; and unfortunately they had not been able
to procure a skin. However, they carried some
flour well moistened in their wooden bowl, which
they covered with a large piece of wet linen, and
studied to keep from the sun. They traveled
almost without intermission the whole of that
day and a great part of the night. Ali now saw
that it was necessary to rest, and they remained
where they were until near morning.</p>

<p>"Dearest Amina," said he, returning to the
young girl after having climbed to the top of a
lofty rock and gazed anxiously ahead, "I think
I see the mountain where the next water is to be
found. If thou art strong enough, we will push
on at once."</p>

<p>Though faint and weary, Amina said: "Let
us be going;" and now it was necessary for Ali
to walk, the horse refusing to carry any longer a
double burden. They advanced, however, rapidly;
and at length reached the foot of a lofty range
of mountains, all white, and shining in the sun
like silver. In one of the gorges near the summit
Ali knew there was usually a small reservoir
of water; but he had only been there once in his
boyhood, when on his way to visit the tribe with
which he now expected to find a shelter. However,
he thought he recognized various landmarks,
and began to ascend with confidence.
The sun beat furiously down on the barren and
glistering ground; and the horse exhausted, more
than once refused to proceed. He had not eaten
once since their departure, and Ali knew that
he must perish ere the journey was concluded.</p>

<p>As they neared the summit of the ridge, the
young man recognized with joy a rock in the
shape of a crouching camel that had formerly
been pointed out to him as indicating the neighborhood
of the reservoir, and pressed on with renewed
confidence. What was his horror, however,
on reaching the place he sought, at beholding
it quite dry! dry, and hot as an oven! The
water had all escaped by a crevice recently formed.
Ali now believed that death was inevitable;
and folding the fainting Amina in his arms, sat
down and bewailed his lot in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Suddenly a strange sight presented itself. A
small caravan appeared coming down the ravine&mdash;not
of camels, nor of horses, nor asses, but of
goats and a species of wild antelope. They
moved slowly, and behind them walked with tottering
steps a man of great age with a vast white
beard, supporting himself with a long stick. Ali
rushed forward to a goat which bore a water-skin,
seized it, and without asking permission carried
it to Amina. Both drank with eagerness; and
it was not until they were well satisfied that
they noticed the strange old man looking at them
with interest and curiosity. Then they told their
story; and the owner of the caravan in his turn
told his, which was equally wonderful.</p>

<p>"And what was the old man's story?" inquired
the listeners in one breath.</p>

<p>"It shall be related to-morrow. The time for
sleep has come."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>I was not fortunate enough to hear the conclusion
of this legend, told in the simple matter-of-fact
words of Wahsa; but one of our attendants
gave me the substance. The old man of the
caravan was stated to be the younger of the two
watchers left behind more than a hundred years
before at Bir Hassan. His companion had been
killed, and he himself wounded by some wild
beast, which had prevented the necessary signals
from being made. He understood that some terrible
disaster had occurred, and dared not brave
the vengeance which he thought menaced him
from the survivors. So he resolved to stay in
the valley, and had accordingly remained for a
hundred years, at the expiration of which period
he had resolved to set out on a pilgrimage to the
Nile, in order to ascertain if any members of the
tribes still remained, that he might communicate
the secret of the valley before he perished. Like
the first discoverer, he had marked the way by
heaps of stones, and died when his narrative was
concluded. Ali and Amina made their way to
the valley, where, according to the narrative, they
found a large city, scarcely if at all ruined, and
took up their abode in one of the palaces. Shortly
afterward Ali returned to Egypt, and led off his
father, Abdallah the Good, and the remnants of
his tribe in secret. Omar was furious, and following
them, endeavored to discover the valley,
of which the tradition was well known. Not
succeeding, he resolved to wait for the summer;
but the tribe never reappeared in Egypt, and is
said to have passed the hot months in the oasis
of Farafreh, to which they subsequently removed
on the destruction of their favorite valley by an
earthquake.</p>

<p>This tradition, though containing some improbable
incidents, may nevertheless be founded on
fact, and may contain, under a legendary form,
the history of the peopling of the oases of the
desert. It is, however, chiefly interesting from
the manner in which it illustrates the important
influence which the discovery or destruction of a
copious well of pure water may exercise on the
fortunes of a people. It may sometimes, in fact,
as represented in this instance, be a matter of life
and death; and no doubt the Waled Allah are
not the only tribe who have been raised to an
enviable prosperity, or sunk into the depths of
misery, by the fluctuating supply of water in the
desert.</p>

<h2>THE BOW-WINDOW</h2>

<h3>AN ENGLISH TALE</h3>


<p>There is something so English, so redolent
of home, of flowers in large antique stands,
about a bow-window, that we are always pleased
when we catch a glimpse of one, even if it be
when but forming the front of an inn. It gives
a picturesque look too, to a home, that is quite
refreshing to gaze on, and when journeying in
foreign lands, fond recollections of dear England
come flooding o'er us, if we happen, in some out-of-the-way
village, on such a memory of the land
from whence we came. I have not, from absence
from my country, seen such a thing for some few
years; but there is one fresh in my memory,
with its green short Venetian blinds, its large
chintz curtains, its comfortable view up and down
the terrace where we lived, to say nothing of its
associations in connection with my childhood.
But it is not of this bow-window that I would
speak, it is of one connected with the fortunes
of my friend Maria Walker, and which had a
considerable influence on her happiness.</p>

<p>Maria Walker was usually allowed to be the
beauty of one of the small towns round London
in the direction of Greenwich, of which ancient
place she was a native. Her father had originally
practiced as a physician in that place, but
circumstances had caused his removal to another
locality, which promised more profitable returns.
The house they occupied was an ancient red
brick mansion in the centre of the town, with a
large bow-window, always celebrated for its geraniums,
myrtles, and roses that, with a couple
of small orange-trees, were the admiration of the
neighborhood. Not that Thomas Walker, Esq.
had any horticultural tastes&mdash;on the contrary, he
was very severe on our sex for devoting their
minds to such trifles as music, flowers, and fancy
work; but then blue-eyed Maria Walker differed
with him in opinion, and plainly told him
so&mdash;saucy, pert girl, as even I thought her,
though several years my senior. Not that she
neglected any more serious duties for those lighter
amusements; the poorer patients of her father
ever found in her a friend. Mr. Walker strongly
objected to giving any thing away, it was a bad
example, he said, and people never valued what
they got for nothing; but many was the box of
pills and vial of medicine which Maria smuggled
under her father's very nose, to poor people
who could not afford to pay; of course he knew
nothing about it, good, easy man, though it would
have puzzled a philosopher to have told how the
girl could have prepared them. She was an active
member, too, of a charitable coal club, made
flannel for the poor, and even distributed tracts
upon occasion. When this was done, then she
would turn to her pleasures, which were her little
world. She was twenty, and I was not sixteen
at the time of which I speak, but yet we
were the best friends in the world. I used to
go and sit in the bow-window; while she would
play the piano for hours together, I had some
fancy-work on my lap; but my chief amusement
was to watch the passers-by. I don't think that
I am changed by half-a-dozen more years of experience,
for I still like a lively street, and dislike
nothing more than a look out upon a square
French court in this great city of Paris, where
houses are more like prisons than pleasant residences.
But to return to my bow-window.</p>

<p>In front of the house of the Walkers, had been,
a few years before, an open space, but which
now, thanks to the rapid march of improvement,
was being changed into a row of very good
houses. There were a dozen of them, and they
were dignified with the name of Beauchamp Terrace.
They were, about the time I speak of, all
to let; the last finishing touch had been put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
them, the railings had been painted, the rubbish
all removed, and they wanted nothing, save furniture
and human beings to make them assume
a civilized and respectable appearance. I called
one morning on Maria Walker, her father was
out, she had been playing the piano till she was
tired, so we sat down in the bow-window and
talked.</p>

<p>"So the houses are letting?" said I, who took
an interest in the terrace which I had seen grow
under my eyes.</p>

<p>"Two are let," replied she, "and both to private
families; papa is pleased, he looks upon
these twelve houses as twelve new patients."</p>

<p>"But," said I, laughing, "have you not read
the advertisement: 'Healthy and airy situation,
rising neighborhood, and yet only one medical
man.'"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," smiled Maria; "but sickness, I
am sorry to say, is very apt to run about at some
time or other, even in airy situations."</p>

<p>"But, Maria, you are mistaken, there are three
houses let," said I, suddenly, "the bill is taken
down opposite, it has been let since yesterday."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I recollect a very nice young man
driving up there yesterday, and looking over the
house for an hour; I suppose he has taken it."</p>

<p>"A nice young man," said I, "that is very interesting&mdash;I
suppose a young couple just married."</p>

<p>"Very likely," replied Maria Walker, laughing;
but whether at the fact of my making up
my mind to its being an interesting case of matrimony,
or what else, I know not.</p>

<p>It was a week before I saw Maria again, and
when I did, she caught me by the hand, drew
me rapidly to the window, and with a semi-tragic
expression, pointed to the house over the way.
I looked. What was my astonishment when, on
the door in large letters, I read these words,
"Mr. Edward Radstock, M. D."</p>

<p>"A rival," cried I, clapping my hands, thoughtless
girl that I was; "another feud of Montague
and Capulet. Maria, could not a Romeo and
Juliet be found to terminate it?"</p>

<p>"Don't laugh," replied Maria, gravely; "papa
is quite ill with vexation; imagine, in a small
town like this, two doctors! it's all the fault of
that advertisement. Some scheming young man
has seen it, and finding no hope of practice elsewhere,
has come here. I suppose he is as poor
as a rat."</p>

<p>At this instant the sound of horses' footsteps
was heard, and then three vans full of furniture
appeared in sight. They were coming our way.
We looked anxiously to see before which house
they stopped. I must confess that what Maria
said interested me in the young doctor, and I
really hoped all this was for him. Maria said
nothing, but, with a frown on her brow, she
waited the progress of events. As I expected,
the vans stopped before the young doctor's house,
and in a few minutes the men began to unload.
My friend turned pale as she saw that the vehicles
were full of elegant furniture.</p>

<p>"The wretch has got a young wife, too," she
exclaimed, as a piano and harp came to view,
and then she added, rising, "this will never
do; they must be put down at once; <i>they</i> are
strangers in the neighborhood, <i>we</i> are well known.
Sit down at that desk, my dear girl, and help me
to make out a list of all the persons <i>we</i> can invite
to a ball and evening party. I look upon
them as impertinent interlopers, and they must
be crushed."</p>

<p>I laughingly acquiesced, and aided by her,
soon wrote out a list of invitations to be given.</p>

<p>"But now," said Miss Walker, after a few
moments of deep reflection, "one name more
must be added, <i>they</i> must be invited."</p>

<p>"Who?" exclaimed I, in a tone of genuine
surprise.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Edward Radstock," replied
Maria, triumphantly, while I could scarcely speak
from astonishment.</p>

<p>The rest of my narrative I collected from the
lips of my friend, a little more than a year later.</p>

<p>The ball took place to the admiration of all
C&mdash;&mdash;. It was a splendid affair: a select band
came down from London, in which two foreigners,
with dreadfully un-euphonic names, played
upon two unknown instruments, that deafened
nearly every sensitive person in the room, and
would have driven every body away, had not
they been removed into the drawing-room balcony;
then there was a noble Italian, reduced
to a tenor-singer, who astonished the company,
equally by the extraordinary number of strange
songs that he sang, and the number of ices and
jellies which he ate; then there were one or two
literary men, who wrote anonymously, but might
have been celebrated, only they scorned to put
their names forward among the common herd,
the &#959;&#7985; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#943; already known to the public; there
was a young poet too, who thought Alfred Tennyson
infinitely superior to Shakspeare, and by
the air with which he read a poem, seemed to
insinuate that he himself was greater than either;
and then there was a funny gentleman, who could
imitate Henry Russell, John Parry, Buckstone,
or any body, only he had a cold and could not
get beyond a negro recitation, which might have
been Chinese poetry for all the company understood
of it. In fact it was the greatest affair of
the kind which C&mdash;&mdash; had seen for many a long
day. Mr. and <i>Miss</i> Radstock came, and were
received with cold politeness by both father and
daughter. The young man was good-looking,
with an intelligent eye, a pleasing address, and
none of that pertness of manner which usually
belongs to those who have just thrown off the
medical student to become the doctor. Miss
Radstock, his sister, who kept house for him,
until he found a wife, was a charming girl of
about twenty. She smiled at the manner of both
Mr. and Miss Walker, but said nothing. Young
Radstock's only revenge for the lady of the
house's coldness and stateliness of tone, was
asking her to dance at the first opportunity,
which certainly was vexatious, for his tone was
so pleasing, his manner so courteous, that my
friend Maria could not but feel pleased&mdash;when
she wanted to be irate, distant, and haughty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>They danced together several times, and to
the astonishment of many friends of the young
lady, of myself in particular, they went down to
supper the best friends in the world, laughing
and joking like old acquaintances.</p>

<p>Next day, however, she resumed her original
coldness of manner when the brother and sister
called to pay their respects. She was simply
polite, and no more, and after two or three words
they retired, Emily Radstock becoming as stiff
and formal as her new acquaintance. From that
day Maria became very miserable. She was not
avaricious, and did not fear her father losing his
practice from any pecuniary motives, but it was
pride that influenced her. Her father had for
some years monopolized the parish, as his predecessor
had for forty years before him; and
now to behold a young unfledged physician setting
up exactly opposite, and threatening to divide
in time the business of the town, was dreadful.
<i>The</i> physician of the town, sounded better,
too, than one of the doctors, and altogether it
was a most unpleasant affair.</p>

<p>Maria's place was now always the bow-window.
She had no amusement but to watch the
opposite house, to see if patients came, or if
Edward Radstock made any attempt to call about
and introduce himself. But for some time she
had the satisfaction of remarking, that not a soul
called at the house, save the butcher, the baker,
and other contributors to the interior comforts
of man, and Maria began to feel the hope that
Edward Radstock would totally fail in his endeavors
to introduce himself. She remarked,
however, that the young man took it very quietly;
he sat by his sister's side while she played
the piano, or with a book and a cigar at the open
window, or took Emily a drive in his gig; always,
when he remarked Maria at the open window,
bowing with provoking courtesy, nothing
daunted by her coldness of manner, or her pretense
of not noticing his politeness.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Walker was out, he had been
called to a distance to see a patient, who was
very seriously ill, when Maria sat at the bow-window
looking up the street. Suddenly she
saw a boy come running down on their side of
the way; she knew him by his bright buttons,
light jacket, and gold lace. It was the page of
the Perkinses, a family with a host of little children,
who, from constant colds, indigestions, and
fits of illness, caused by too great a liking for the
pleasures of the table, which a fond mother had
not the heart to restrain, were continually on
Mr. Walker's books.</p>

<p>The boy rang violently at the bell, and Maria
opened the parlor-door and listened.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Walker at home?" said the boy,
scarcely able to speak from want of breath.</p>

<p>"No," replied the maid who had opened the door.</p>

<p>"He will be home directly," said Maria, advancing.</p>

<p>"Oh! but missus can't wait, there's little Peter
been and swallowed a marble, and the baby's
took with fits," and away rushed the boy across
the road to the hated rival's house.</p>

<p>Maria retreated into her room and sank down
upon a sofa. The enemy had gained an entrance
into the camp, it was quite clear. In a moment
more she rose, just in time to see Mr. Edward
Radstock hurrying down the street beside the
little page, without waiting to order his gig.
This was a severe blow to the doctor's daughter.
The Perkinses were a leading family in the town,
and one to whom her father was called almost
every day in the year. They had a large circle
of acquaintances, and if young Radstock became
their medical adviser, others would surely follow.
In about an hour, the young man returned and
joined his sister in the drawing-room, as if nothing
had happened. This was more provoking
than his success. If he had assumed an air of
importance and bustle, and had hurried up to
inform his sister with an air of joy and triumph
of what had happened, she might have been
tempted to pity him, but he did every thing in
such a quiet, gentlemanly way, that she felt considerable
alarm for the future.</p>

<p>Maria was in the habit of spending most of
her evenings from home, her father being generally
out, and that large house in consequence
lonely. The town of C&mdash;&mdash; was famous for its
tea and whist-parties, and though Maria was not
of an age to play cards, except to please others,
she, however, sometimes condescended to do so.
One evening she was invited to the house of a
Mrs. Brunton, who announced her intention of
receiving company every Thursday. She went,
and found the circle very pleasant and agreeable,
but, horror of horrors&mdash;there was Mr. Edward
Radstock and his sister Emily; and worse than
that, when a lady present volunteered to play a
quadrille, and the ladies accepted eagerly, up he
came, of all others, to invite her to dance! Mrs.
Brunton the instant before had asked her to play
at whist, to oblige three regular players, who
could not find a fourth.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," she said, quietly, but in rather
distant tones, "I am engaged"&mdash;the young man
looked surprised, even hurt, for no gentleman
had spoken to her since she had entered the
room&mdash;"to make a fourth at the whist-table,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, go and dance, Miss Walker," exclaimed
Mrs. Brunton, "I did not know dancing was going
to begin, when I asked you to make up a rubber."</p>

<p>Maria offered her hand to the young man, and
walked away to the dancing-room. Despite herself,
that evening she was very much pleased
with him. He was well informed, had traveled,
was full of taste and feeling, and conversed with
animation and originality; he sought every opportunity
of addressing himself to her, and found
these opportunities without much difficulty. For
several Thursdays the same thing occurred. The
young man began to find a little practice. He
was popular wherever he went, and whenever
he was called in was quite sure of keeping up
the connection. He was asked out to all the
principal parties in the town; and had Mr.
Walker been not very much liked, would have
proved a very serious rival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning the father and daughter were at
breakfast. Maria, who began to like her bow-window
better than ever, sat near it to scent the
fragrance of her flowers. When the young doctor
came out, she always now returned his bow,
and a young lady opposite declared in confidence
to her dressmaker that she had even kissed her
hand to him once. However this may be, Maria
sat at the bow-window, pouring out tea for her
father in a very abstracted mood. Mr. Walker
had been called out at an early hour, and returned
late. He was not in the best of humors,
having waited four hours beyond his time for
his tea.</p>

<p>"I shall die in the workhouse," said he, as
he buttered his toast with an irritability of manner
quite alarming. "This Radstock is getting
all the practice. I heard of two new patients
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa," replied Maria, gently. "I don't
think he has got a dozen altogether."</p>

<p>"A dozen&mdash;but that's a dozen lost to me, miss.
It's a proof that people think me old&mdash;worn out&mdash;useless."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, papa; C&mdash;&mdash; is increasing in
population every day, and for every one he gets,
you get two."</p>

<p>"My dear," replied Mr. Walker, with considerable
animation, "I think you are beginning to
side with my rival."</p>

<p>A loud knocking came this instant to the door,
and the man-servant immediately after announced
"Dr. Radstock."</p>

<p>Mr. Walker had no time to make any remark,
ere the young man entered the room, bowing
most politely to the old gentleman and his
daughter; both looked confused, and the father
much surprised. He was in elegant morning
costume, and looked both handsome and happy&mdash;the
old doctor thought, triumphant.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir," said he, "for disturbing
you at this early hour; but your numerous calls
take you so much out, that one must take you
when one can find you. My errand will doubtless
surprise you, but I am very frank and open;
my object in visiting you is to ask permission to
pay my addresses to your daughter."</p>

<p>"To do what, sir?" thundered the old doctor
in a towering passion. "Are you not satisfied
with trying to take from me my practice, but you
must ask me for my child? I tell you, sir, nothing
on earth would make me consent to your
marriage with my daughter."</p>

<p>"But, sir," said Edward Radstock, turning to
Maria, "I have your daughter's permission to
make this request. I told her of my intentions
last night, and she authorized me to say that she
approved of them."</p>

<p>"Maria," exclaimed the father, almost choking
with rage, "is this true?"</p>

<p>"My dear papa, I am in no hurry to get married,
but if I did, I must say, that I should never
think of marrying any one but Edward Radstock.
I will not get married against your will, but I
will never marry any one else; nothing will
make me."</p>

<p>"Ungrateful girl," muttered Mr. Thomas
Walker, and next minute he sank back in his
chair in a fit of apoplexy.</p>

<p>"Open the window, raise the blinds," said the
young man, preparing with promptitude and
earnestness to take the necessary remedies, "be
not alarmed. It is not a dangerous attack."</p>

<p>Maria quietly obeyed her lover, quite aware
of the necessity of self-possession and presence
of mind in a case like the present. In half an
hour Mr. Walker was lying in a large, airy bedroom,
and the young man had left, at the request
of Maria, to attend a patient of her father's. It
was late at night before Edward was able to take
a moment's rest. What with his own patients,
and those of his rival, he was overwhelmed with
business; but at eleven o'clock he approached
the bedside of the father of Maria, who, with her
dear Emily now by her side, sat watching.</p>

<p>"He sleeps soundly," said Maria in a low tone,
as Edward entered.</p>

<p>"Yes, and is doing well," replied Radstock.
"I answer for his being up and stirring to-morrow,
if he desires it."</p>

<p>"But it will be better for him to rest some
days," said Maria.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Miss Walker," continued the
young doctor, "what will his patients do?"</p>

<p>"You can attend to them as you have done
to-day," replied Maria.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Walker, you, who know me,
could trust me with your father's patients; you
know, that when he was able to go about, I
would hand them all back to him without hesitation.
But you must be aware, that for your
father to discover me attending to his patients,
would retard his recovery. If I do as you ask
me, I must retire from C&mdash;&mdash; immediately on his
convalescence."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Dr. Walker, in a faint voice,
"I shall not be about for a month; after making
me take to my bed, the least you can do is to attend
to my patients."</p>

<p>"If you wish it, sir&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I insist upon it; and to prevent any opposition,
you can say we are going into partnership."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" said Edward.</p>

<p>"If you want my daughter," continued Dr.
Walker, gruffly, "you must do as I tell you. If
you wish to be my son-in-law, you must be my
partner, work like a horse, slave day and night,
while I smoke my pipe and drink my grog."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," exclaimed the young man,
"you overwhelm me."</p>

<p>"Dear papa!" said Maria.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear papa!" muttered old Walker;
"pretty girl you are; give a party to crush the
interloper; faint when he gets his first patient;
watch him from your bow-window like a cat
watches a mouse, and then&mdash;marry him."</p>

<p>"But, my dear papa, is not this the surest
way to destroy the opposition?" said happy
Maria.</p>

<p>"Yes! because we can not crush him, we
take him as a partner," grumbled old Walker;
"never heard of such a thing; nice thing it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to have children who take part with your enemies."</p>

<p>Nobody made any reply, and after a little
more faint attempts at fault-finding, the old doctor
fell asleep.</p>

<p>About six months later, after a journey to
Scotland, which made me lose sight of Maria, I
drove up the streets of C&mdash;&mdash;, after my return
to my native Greenwich, which, with its beautiful
park, its Blackheath, its splendid and glorious
monument of English greatness, its historic
associations, I dearly love, and eager to see the
dear girl, never stopped until I was in her arms.</p>

<p>"How you have grown," said she, with a
sweet and happy smile.</p>

<p>"Grown! indeed; do you take me for a child?"
cried I, laughing. "And you! how well and
pleased you look; always at the bow-window,
too; I saw you as I came up."</p>

<p>"I am very seldom there now," said she, with
a strange smile.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I live over the way," replied she,
still smiling.</p>

<p>"Over the way?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear girl; alas! for the mutability
of human things&mdash;Maria Walker is now Mrs.
Radstock."</p>

<p>I could not help it; I laughed heartily. I was
very glad. I had been interested in the young
man, and the <i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ement</i> was delightful.</p>

<p>The firm of Walker and Radstock prospered
remarkably without rivalry, despite a great increase
in the neighborhood; but the experience
of the old man, and the perseverance of the
young, frightened away all opposition. They
proved satisfactorily that union is indeed strength.
Young Radstock was a very good husband. He
told me privately that he had fallen in love with
Maria the very first day he saw her; and every
time I hear from them I am told of a fresh accession
to the number of faces that stare across
for grandpapa, who generally, when about to pay
them a visit, shows himself first at the Bow-window.</p>

<h2>THE FRENCH FLOWER GIRL.</h2>


<p>I was lingering listlessly over a cup of coffee
on the Boulevard des Italiens, in June. At
that moment I had neither profound nor useful
resources of thought. I sate simply conscious
of the cool air, the blue sky, the white houses, the
lights, and the lions, which combine to render
that universally pleasant period known as "after
dinner," so peculiarly agreeable in Paris.</p>

<p>In this mood my eyes fell upon a pair of orbs
fixed intently upon me. Whether the process
was effected by the eyes, or by some pretty little
fingers, simply, I can not say; but, at the same
moment, a rose was insinuated into my button-hole,
a gentle voice addressed me, and I beheld,
in connection with the eyes, the fingers, and the
voice, a girl. She carried on her arm a basket
of flowers, and was, literally, nothing more nor
less than one of the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;res</i> who fly along
the Boulevards like butterflies, with the difference
that they turn their favorite flowers to a more
practical account.</p>

<p>Following the example of some other distracted
<i>d&eacute;cor&eacute;s</i>, who I found were sharing my honors,
I placed a piece of money&mdash;I believe, in my case,
it was silver&mdash;in the hand of the girl; and, receiving
about five hundred times its value, in the
shape of a smile and a "<i>Merci bien, monsieur!</i>"
was again left alone&mdash;("desolate," a Frenchman
would have said)&mdash;in the crowded and carousing
Boulevard.</p>

<p>To meet a perambulating and persuasive
<i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i>, who places a flower in your coat and
waits for a pecuniary acknowledgment, is scarcely
a rare adventure in Paris; but I was interested&mdash;unaccountably
so&mdash;in this young girl: her whole manner and bearing was so
different and distinct from all others of her calling. Without
any of that appearance which, in England, we
are accustomed to call "theatrical," she was such
a being as we can scarcely believe in out of a
ballet. Not, however, that her attire departed&mdash;except,
perhaps, in a certain coquetish simplicity&mdash;from
the conventional mode: its only decorations
seemed to be ribbons, which also gave a
character to the little cap that perched itself with
such apparent insecurity upon her head. Living
a life that seemed one long summer's day&mdash;one
floral <i>f&ecirc;te</i>&mdash;with a means of existence that seemed
so frail and immaterial&mdash;she conveyed an impression
of <i>unreality</i>. She might be likened to a
Nymph, or a Naiad, but for the certain something
that brought you back to the theatre, intoxicating
the senses, at once, with the strange, indescribable
fascinations of hot chandeliers&mdash;close and
perfumed air&mdash;foot-lights, and fiddlers.</p>

<p>Evening after evening I saw the same girl&mdash;generally
at the same place&mdash;and, it may be
readily imagined, became one of the most constant
of her <i>clientelle</i>. I learned, too, as many
facts relating to her as could be learned where
most was mystery. Her peculiar and persuasive
mode of disposing of her flowers (a mode which
has since become worse than vulgarized by bad
imitators) was originally her own graceful instinct&mdash;or
whim, if you will. It was something new
and natural, and amused many, while it displeased
none. The sternest of stockbrokers, even, could
not choose but be decorated. Accordingly, this
new Nydia of Thessaly went out with her basket
one day, awoke next morning, and found herself
famous.</p>

<p>Meantime there was much discussion, and
more mystification, as to who this Queen of
Flowers could be&mdash;where she lived&mdash;and so forth.
Nothing was known of her except her name&mdash;Hermance.
More than one adventurous student&mdash;you
may guess I am stating the number within
bounds&mdash;traced her steps for hour after hour,
till night set in&mdash;in vain. Her flowers disposed
of, she was generally joined by an old man, respectably
clad, whose arm she took with a certain
confidence, that sufficiently marked him as
a parent or protector; and the two always contrived
sooner or later, in some mysterious manner, to disappear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>After all stratagems have failed, it generally
occurs to people to ask a direct question. But
this in the present case was impossible. Hermance
was never seen except in very public
places&mdash;often in crowds&mdash;and to exchange twenty
consecutive words with her, was considered
a most fortunate feat. Notwithstanding, too,
her strange, wild way of gaining her livelihood,
there was a certain dignity in her manner which
sufficed to cool the too curious.</p>

<p>As for the directors of the theatres, they exhibited
a most appropriate amount of madness on
her account; and I believe that at several of the
theatres, Hermance might have commanded her
own terms. But only one of these miserable
men succeeded in making a tangible proposal,
and he was treated with most glorious contempt.
There was, indeed, something doubly dramatic
in the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re's</i> disdain of the drama. She
who <i>lived</i> a romance could never descend to act
one. She would rather be Rosalind than Rachel.
She refused the part of Cerito, and chose to be
an Alma on her own account.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that where there was so
much mystery, imagination would not be idle.
To have believed all the conflicting stories about
Hermance, would be to come to the conclusion
that she was the stolen child of noble parents,
brought up by an <i>ouvrier</i>: but that somehow
her father was a tailor of dissolute habits, who
lived a contented life of continual drunkenness,
on the profits of his daughter's industry;&mdash;that
her mother was a deceased duchess&mdash;but, on the
other hand, was alive, and carried on the flourishing
business of a <i>blanchisseuse</i>. As for the private
life of the young lady herself, it was reflected
in such a magic mirror of such contradictory
impossibilities, in the delicate discussions held
upon the subject, that one had no choice but to
disbelieve every thing.</p>

<p>One day a new impulse was given to this gossip
by the appearance of the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i> in a
startling hat of some expensive straw, and of a
make bordering on the ostentatious. It could
not be doubted that the profits of her light labors
were sufficient to enable her to multiply such
finery to almost any extent, had she chosen; but
in Paris the adoption of a bonnet or a hat, in
contradistinction to the little cap of the <i>grisette</i>,
is considered an assumption of a superior grade,
and unless warranted by the "position" of the
wearer, is resented as an impertinence. In Paris,
indeed, there are only two classes of women&mdash;those
with bonnets, and those without; and these
stand in the same relation to one another, as the
two great classes into which the world may be
divided&mdash;the powers that be, and the powers that
want to be. Under these circumstances, it may
be supposed that the surmises were many and
marvelous. The little <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i> was becoming
proud&mdash;becoming a lady;&mdash;but how? why? and
above all&mdash;where? Curiosity was never more
rampant, and scandal never more inventive.</p>

<p>For my part, I saw nothing in any of these
appearances worthy, in themselves, of a second
thought; nothing could have destroyed the strong
and strange interest which I had taken in the
girl; and it would have required something more
potent than a straw hat&mdash;however coquettish in
crown, and audacious in brim&mdash;to have shaken
my belief in her truth and goodness. Her presence,
for the accustomed few minutes, in the
afternoon or evening, became to me&mdash;I will not
say a necessity, but certainly a habit;&mdash;and a
habit is sufficiently despotic when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A fair face and a tender voice have made me&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I will not say "mad and blind," as the remainder
of the line would insinuate&mdash;but most deliciously
in my senses, and most luxuriously
wide awake!</p>

<p>But to come to the catastrophe&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One morn we missed <i>her</i> in the accustomed spot&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not only, indeed, from "accustomed" and probable
spots, but from unaccustomed, improbable,
and even impossible spots&mdash;all of which were
duly searched&mdash;was she missed. In short, she
was not to be found at all. All was amazement
on the Boulevards. Hardened old <i>flaneurs</i> turned
pale under their rouge, and some of the younger
ones went about with drooping mustaches,
which, for want of the <i>cire</i>, had fallen into the
"yellow leaf."</p>

<p>A few days sufficed, however, for the cure of
these sentimentalities. A clever little monkey
at the Hippodrome, and a gentleman who stood
on his head while he ate his dinner, became the
immediate objects of interest, and Hermance
seemed to be forgotten. I was one of the few
who retained any hope of finding her, and my
wanderings for that purpose, without any guide,
clew, information, or indication, seem to me now
something absurd. In the course of my walks,
I met an old man, who was pointed out to me as
her father&mdash;met him frequently, alone. The expression
of his face was quite sufficient to assure
me that he was on the same mission&mdash;and with
about as much chance of success as myself.
Once I tried to speak to him; but he turned
aside, and avoided me with a manner that there
could be no mistaking. This surprised me, for
I had no reason to suppose that he had ever seen
my face before.</p>

<p>A paragraph in one of the newspapers at last
threw some light on the matter. The <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i>
had never been so friendless or unprotected as
people had supposed. In all her wanderings she
was accompanied, or rather followed, by her father;
whenever she stopped, then he stopped
also; and never was he distant more than a
dozen yards, I wonder that he was not recognized
by hundreds, but I conclude he made some
change in his attire or appearance, from time to
time. One morning this strange pair were proceeding
on their ramble as usual, when, passing
through a rather secluded street, the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i>
made a sudden bound from the pavement, sprung
into a post-chaise, the door of which stood open,
and was immediately whirled away, as fast as
four horses could tear&mdash;leaving the old man
alone with his despair, and the basket of flowers.</p>

<p>Three months have passed away since the disappearance
of the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i>; but only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> few
days since I found myself one evening very dull
at one of those "brilliant receptions," for which
Paris is so famous. I was making for the door,
with a view to an early departure, when my hostess
detained me, for the purpose of presenting
me to a lady who was monopolizing all the admiration
of the evening&mdash;she was the newly-married
bride of a young German baron of great
wealth, and noted for a certain wild kind of
genius, and utter scorn of conventionalities. The
next instant I found myself introduced to a pair
of eyes that could never be mistaken. I dropped
into a vacant chair by their side, and entered
into conversation. The baronne observed that
she had met me before, but could not remember
where, and in the same breath asked me if I was
a lover of flowers.</p>

<p>I muttered something about loving beauty in
any shape, and admired a bouquet which she
held in her hand.</p>

<p>The baronne selected a flower, and asked me
if it was not a peculiarly fine specimen. I assented;
and the flower, not being re-demanded,
I did not return it. The conversation changed
to other subjects, and, shortly afterward the baronne
took her leave with her husband. They
left Paris next day for the baron's family estate,
and I have never seen them since.</p>

<p>I learned subsequently that some strange stories
had obtained circulation respecting the previous
life of the baronne. Whatever they were,
it is very certain that this or some other reason
has made the profession of <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i> most
inconveniently popular in Paris. Young ladies of
all ages that can, with any degree of courtesy,
be included in that category, and of all degrees
of beauty short of the hunch-back, may be seen
in all directions intruding their flowers with fatal
pertinacity upon inoffensive loungers, and making
war upon button-holes that never did them
any harm. The youngest of young girls, I find,
are being trained to the calling, who are all destined,
I suppose, to marry distinguished foreigners
from some distant and facetious country.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned before, that a friend
calling upon me the morning after my meeting
with the baronne, saw the flower which she had
placed in my hand standing in a glass of water
on the table. An idea struck me: "Do you
know any thing of the language of flowers?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Something," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What, then, is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Secrecy.</span>"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>DIFFICULTY.</h2>


<p>There is an aim which all Nature seeks;
the flower that opens from the bud&mdash;the
light that breaks the cloud into a thousand forms
of beauty&mdash;is calmly striving to assume the perfect
glory of its power; and the child, whose
proud laugh heralds the mastery of a new lesson,
unconsciously develops the same life-impulse
seeking to prove the power it has felt its
own.</p>

<p>This is the real goal of life shining dimly from
afar; for as our fullest power was never yet attained,
it is a treasure which must be sought,
its extent and distance being unknown. No man
can tell what he can do, or suffer, until tried;
his path of action broadens out before him; and,
while a path appears, there is power to traverse
it. It is like the fabled hill of Genius, that ever
presented a loftier elevation above the one attained.
It is like the glory of the stars, which
shine by borrowed light, each seeming source of
which is tributary to one more distant, until the
view is lost to us; yet we only know there must
be a life-giving centre, and, to the steady mind,
though the goal of life be dim and distant, its
light is fixed and certain, while all lesser aims
are but reflections of this glory in myriad-descending
shades, which must be passed, one by
one, as the steps of the ladder on which he
mounts to Heaven.</p>

<p>Man has an unfortunate predilection to pervert
whatever God throws in his way to aid him,
and thus turn good to evil. The minor hopes
which spur to action are mistaken for the final
one; and we often look no higher than some
mean wish, allowing that to rule us which should
have been our servant. From this false view
rises little exertion, for it is impossible for man
to believe in something better and be content
with worse. We all aim at self-control and independence
while in the shadow of a power which
controls us, whispering innerly, "Thus far shalt
thou go, and no farther;" but how apt is self-indulgence
to suit this limit to its own measure,
and suffer veneration and doubt to overgrow and
suppress the rising hope of independent thought.
"I am not permitted to know this, or to do this,"
is the excuse of the weak and trivial; but the
question should be, "<i>Can</i> I know or do this?"
for what is not permitted we can not do. We
may not know the events of the future, or the
period of a thought, or the Great First Cause,
but we may hope to see and combine the atoms
of things&mdash;pierce the realms of space&mdash;make the
wilderness a garden&mdash;attain perfection of soul
and body; and for this our end we may master
all things needful.</p>

<p>There is nothing possible that faith and striving
can not do; take the road, and it must lead
you to the goal, though strewn with difficulties,
and cast through pain and shade. If each would
strain his energies to gain what he has dared to
hope for, he would succeed, for since that which
we love and honor is in our nature, it is to be
drawn forth, and what is not there we can not
wish.</p>

<p>Our greatest drawback is, not that we expect
too much, but that we do too little; we set our
worship low, and let our higher powers lie dormant;
thus are we never masters, but blind men
stumbling in each other's way. As maturity
means self-controlling power, so he who gains
not this is childish, and must submit, infant-like,
to be controlled by others. This guidance we
must feel in our upward course, and be grateful
for the check; but as we have each a work to
do, we must look beyond help to independence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
The school-boy receives aid in learning that he
may one day strive with his own power, for if
he always depends on help he can never be a
useful man.</p>

<p>He who seeks for himself no path, but merely
follows where others have been before, covering
his own want with another's industry, may find
the road not long or thickly set, but he does and
gains nothing. He who bows to difficulty, settling
at the foot of the hill instead of struggling
to its top, may get a sheltered place&mdash;a snug retreat,
but the world in its glory he can never see,
and the pestilence from the low ground he must
imbibe. We may rest in perfect comfort, but
the health that comes of labor will fade away.
The trees of the forest were not planted that
man might pass round and live between them,
but that he might cut them down and use them.
The savage has little toil before him, but the
civilized man has greater power of happiness.</p>

<p>Would a man be powerful, and bid his genius
rule his fellow-men? he must toil to gain means;
while his thought reads the hearts that he would
sway, he must be led into temptation, and pass
through pain and danger, ere he can know what
another may endure. Would he pour golden
truth upon the page of life? he must seek it from
every source, weigh the relations of life, and concede
to its taste, that he may best apply it, for
the proverb must be written in fair round hand,
that common men may read it. Would he picture
the life of man or nature? he must go forth
with heart and eye alive, nor turn from the sorest
notes of human woe, or the coarsest tones of vice;
he must watch the finest ray of light, and mark
the falling of the last withered leaf. Would he
be actively benevolent? winter cold, nor summer
lassitude must not appall him; in season and out
of season he must be ready; injured pride,
wounded feeling must not unstring his energy,
while stooping to learn from the simplest lips
the nature of those wants to which he would
minister.</p>

<p>In all accomplishment there is difficulty; the
greater the work, the greater the pains. There
is no such thing as sudden inspiration or grace,
for the steps of life are slow, and what is not
thus attained is nothing worth. In darkness the
eyes must be accustomed to the gloom when objects
appear, one by one, until the most distant
is perceived; but, in a sudden light the eyes are
pained, and blinded, and left weak.</p>

<p>At school, we found that when one difficulty
was surmounted another was presented; mastering
"Addition" would not do&mdash;we must learn
"Subtraction;" so it is in life. A finished work
is a glory won, but a mind content with one accomplishment
is childish, and its weakness renders
it incapable of applying that&mdash;"From him
that hath not shall be taken away even that he
hath;" his one talent shall rise up to him as a
shame. A little sphere insures but little happiness.</p>

<p>There is a time of youth for all; but youth
has a sphere of hope that, embracing the whole
aim which man must work for, gives unbounded
happiness. Thus God would equalize the lot of
all where necessity would create difference; it
is only when states are forced unnaturally that
misery ensues. When those who would seem
to be men are children in endeavor, we see that
God's will is not done, but a falsehood. The
greatest of us have asked and taken guidance in
their rising course, and owned inferiority without
shame; but his is a poor heart that looks to
be inferior ever; and shameful indeed it is, when
those who are thus poor imagine or assume a
right to respect as self-supporting men. How
painfully ridiculous it is to see the lazy man look
down on his struggling wife as the "weaker vessel,"
or the idle sinecurist hold contempt for the
tradesman who is working his way to higher
wealth by honest toil. Were the aims of living
truly seen, no man would be dishonored because
useful. But wait awhile; the world is drawing
near the real point, and we shall find that the self-denying,
fearless energy, that works its will in
spite of pettiness, must gain its end, and become
richest; that the man who begins with a penny
in the hope of thousands will grow wealthier
than his aimless brother of the snug annuity; for
while the largest wealth that is not earned is
limited, the result of ceaseless toil is incalculable,
since the progress of the soul is infinite!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVI.</h3>

<h4>A GLANCE AT THE "PREFECTURE DE POLICE."</h4>


<p>Poor Mahon's melancholy story made a deep
impression upon me, and I returned to Paris
execrating the whole race of spies and "Mouchards,"
and despising, with a most hearty contempt,
a government compelled to use such
agencies for its existence. It seemed to me so
utterly impossible to escape the snares of a system
so artfully interwoven, and so vain to rely
on innocence as a protection, that I felt a kind
of reckless hardihood as to whatever might betide
me, and rode into the Cour of the Prefecture with
a bold indifference as to my fate that I have often
wondered at since.</p>

<p>The horse on which I was mounted was immediately
recognized as I entered; and the obsequious
salutations that met me showed that I
was regarded as one of the trusty followers of
the Minister; and in this capacity was I ushered
into a large waiting-room, where a considerable
number of persons were assembled, whose air
and appearance, now that necessity for disguise
was over, unmistakably pronounced them to be
spies of the police. Some, indeed, were occupied
in taking off their false whiskers and
mustaches; others were removing shades from
their eyes; and one was carefully opening what
had been the hump on his back, in search of a
paper he was anxious to discover.</p>

<p>I had very little difficulty in ascertaining that
these were all the very lowest order of "Mouchards,"
whose sphere of duty rarely led beyond
the Fauxbourg or the Battyriolles, and indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
soon saw that my own appearance among them
led to no little surprise and astonishment.</p>

<p>"You are looking for Nicquard, monsieur?"
said one, "but he has not come yet."</p>

<p>"No; monsieur wants to see Boule-de-Fer,"
said another.</p>

<p>"Here's Jos&eacute; can fetch him," cried a third.</p>

<p>"He'll have to carry him, then," growled out another,
"for I saw him in the Morgue this morning!"</p>

<p>"What! dead?" exclaimed several together.</p>

<p>"As dead as four stabs in the heart and lungs
can make a man! He must have been meddling
where he had no business, for there was a piece
of a lace ruffle found in his fingers."</p>

<p>"Ah, voila!" cried another, "that comes of
mixing in high society."</p>

<p>I did not wait for the discussion that followed,
but stole quietly away, as the disputants were
waxing warm. Instead of turning into the Cour
again, however, I passed out into a corridor, at
the end of which was a door of green cloth.
Pushing open this, I found myself in a chamber,
where a single clerk was writing at a table.</p>

<p>"You're late to-day, and he's not in a good
humor," said he, scarcely looking up from his
paper, "go in!"</p>

<p>Resolving to see my adventure to the end, I
asked no further questions, but passed on to the
room beyond. A person who stood within the
door-way withdrew as I entered, and I found
myself standing face to face with the Marquis de
Maurepas, or, to speak more properly, the Minister
Fouch&eacute;. He was standing at the fire-place
as I came in, reading a newspaper, but no sooner
had he caught sight of me than he laid it down,
and, with his hands crossed behind his back, continued
steadily staring at me.</p>

<p>"Diable!" exclaimed he, at last, "how came
you here?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more naturally, sir, than from the
wish to restore what you were so good as to lend
me, and express my sincere gratitude for a most
hospitable reception."</p>

<p>"But who admitted you?"</p>

<p>"I fancy your saddle-cloth was my introduction,
sir, for it was speedily recognized. Gesler's
cap was never held in greater honor."</p>

<p>"You are a very courageous young gentleman,
I must say&mdash;very courageous, indeed," said he,
with a sardonic grin that was any thing but encouraging.</p>

<p>"The better chance that I may find favor with
Monsieur de Fouch&eacute;," replied I.</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen, sir," said he, seating
himself in his chair, and motioning me to a
spot in front of it. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"A lieutenant of the 9th Hussars, sir; by
name Maurice Tiernay."</p>

<p>"I don't care for that," said he, impatiently;
"what's your occupation?&mdash;how do you live?&mdash;with
whom do you associate?"</p>

<p>"I have neither means nor associates. I have
been liberated from the Temple but a few days
back; and what is to be my future, and where,
are facts of which I know as little as does Monsieur
de Fouch&eacute; of my past history."</p>

<p>"It would seem that every adventurer, every
fellow destitute of home, family, fortune, and
position, thinks that his natural refuge lies in
this Ministry, and that I must be his guardian."</p>

<p>"I never thought so, sir."</p>

<p>"Then why are you here? What other than
personal reasons procures me the honor of this
visit?"</p>

<p>"As Monsieur de Fouch&eacute; will not believe in
my sense of gratitude, perhaps he may put some
faith in my curiosity, and excuse the natural
anxiety I feel to know if Monsieur de Maurepas
has really benefited by the pleasure of my society."</p>

<p>"Hardi, monsieur, bien hardi," said the Minister,
with a peculiar expression of irony about the
mouth that made me almost shudder. He rang
a little hand-bell as he spoke, and a servant made
his appearance.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten to leave me my snuff-box,
Geoffroy," said he, mildly, to the valet, who
at once left the room, and speedily returned with
a magnificently-chased gold box, on which the
initials of the First Consul were embossed in
diamonds.</p>

<p>"Arrange those papers, and place those books
on the shelves," said the Minister. And then
turning to me, as if resuming a previous conversation,
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to that memoir of which we were speaking
t'other night, monsieur, it would be exceedingly
interesting just now; and I have no doubt
that you will see the propriety of confiding to me
what you already promised to Monsieur de
Maurepas. That will do, Geoffroy; leave us."</p>

<p>The servant retired, and we were once more
alone.</p>

<p>"I possess no secrets, sir, worthy the notice
of the Minister of Police," said I boldly.</p>

<p>"Of that I may presume to be the better
judge," said Fouch&eacute; calmly. "But waiving this
question, there is another of some importance.
You have, partly by accident, partly by a boldness
not devoid of peril, obtained some little insight
into the habits and details of this Ministry; at
least, you have seen enough to suspect more, and
misrepresent what you can not comprehend.
Now, sir, there is an almost universal custom in
all secret societies, of making those who intrude
surreptitiously within their limits, to take every
oath and pledge of that society, and to assume
every responsibility that attaches to its voluntary
members&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse my interrupting you, sir; but my
intrusion was purely involuntary; I was made
the dupe of a police spy."</p>

<p>"Having ascertained which," resumed he,
coldly, "your wisest policy would have been to
have kept the whole incident for yourself alone,
and neither have uttered one syllable about it,
nor ventured to come here, as you have done, to
display what you fancy to be your power over
the Minister of Police. You are a very young
man, and the lesson may possibly be of service
to you; and never forget that to attempt a contest
of address with those whose habits have
taught them every wile and subtlety of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
fellow-men, will always be a failure. This
Ministry would be a sorry engine of government
if men of your stamp could out-wit it."</p>

<p>I stood abashed and confused under a rebuke
which, at the same time, I felt to be but half deserved.</p>

<p>"Do you understand Spanish?" asked he suddenly.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not a word."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for it; you should learn that language
without loss of time. Leave your address
with my secretary, and call here by Monday or
Tuesday next."</p>

<p>"If I may presume so far, sir," said I, with a
great effort to seem collected, "I would infer
that your intention is to employ me in some
capacity or other. It is, therefore, better I
should say at once, I have neither the ability nor
the desire for such occupation. I have always
been a soldier. Whatever reverses of fortune I
may meet with, I would wish still to continue in
the same career. At all events, I could never
become a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spy. Say the word out; its meaning conveys
nothing offensive to my ears, young man.
I may grieve over the corruption that requires
such a system; but I do not confound the remedy
with the disease."</p>

<p>"My sentiments are different, sir," said I resolutely,
as I moved toward the door. "I have
the honor to wish you a good morning."</p>

<p>"Stay a moment, Tiernay," said he, looking
for something among his papers; "there are,
probably, situations where all your scruples could
find accommodation, and even be serviceable, too."</p>

<p>"I would rather not place them in peril, Mons.
Le Ministre."</p>

<p>"There are people in this city of Paris who
would not despise my protection, young man;
some of them to the full as well supplied with
the gifts of fortune as Mons. Tiernay."</p>

<p>"And, doubtless, more fitted to deserve it!"
said I, sarcastically; for every moment now rendered
me more courageous.</p>

<p>"And, doubtless, more fitted to deserve it,"
repeated he after me, with a wave of the hand in
token of adieu.</p>

<p>I bowed respectfully, and was retiring, when
he called out in a low and gentle voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before you go, Mons. de Tiernay, I will
thank you to restore my snuff-box."</p>

<p>"Your snuff-box, sir!" cried I, indignantly,
"what do I know of it?"</p>

<p>"In a moment of inadvertence, you may, probably,
have placed it in your pocket," said he,
smiling; "do me the favor to search there."</p>

<p>"This is unnecessary insult, sir," said I
fiercely; "and you forget that I am a French
officer!"</p>

<p>"It is of more consequence that you should
remember it," said he calmly; "and now, sir,
do as I have told you."</p>

<p>"It is well, sir, that this scene has no witness,"
said I, boiling over with passion, "or, by Heaven,
all the dignity of your station should not save you."</p>

<p>"Your observation is most just," said he, with
the same coolness. "It is as well that we are
quite alone; and for this reason I beg to repeat
my request. If you persist in a refusal, and force
me to ring that bell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would not dare to offer me such an indignity,"
said I, trembling with rage.</p>

<p>"You leave me no alternative, sir," said he,
rising, and taking the bell in his hand. "My
honor is also engaged in this question. I have
preferred a charge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have," cried I, interrupting, "and for
whose falsehood I am resolved to hold you responsible."</p>

<p>"To prove which, you must show your innocence."</p>

<p>"There, then&mdash;there are my pockets; here
are the few things I possess. This is my pocket-book&mdash;my
purse. Oh, heavens, what is this?"
cried I, as I drew forth the gold box, along with
the other contents of my pocket; and then staggering
back, I fell, overwhelmed with shame and
sickness, against the wall. For some seconds I
neither saw nor heard any thing; a vague sense
of ineffable disgrace&mdash;of some ignominy that
made life a misery, was over me, and I closed
my eyes with the wish never to open them more.</p>

<p>"The box has a peculiar value in my eyes, sir,"
said he; "it was a present from the First Consul,
otherwise I might have hesitated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, you can not, you dare not, suppose
me guilty of a theft. You seem bent on being
my ruin; but, for mercy's sake, let your hatred
of me take some other shape than this. Involve
me in what snares, what conspiracies you will,
give me what share you please in any guilt, but
spare me the degradation of such a shame."</p>

<p>He seemed to enjoy the torments I was suffering,
and actually revel in the contemplation of my
misery; for he never spoke a word, but continued
steadily to stare me in the face.</p>

<p>"Sit down here, monsieur," said he, at length,
while he pointed to a chair near him; "I wish
to say a few words to you, in all seriousness, and
in good faith, also."</p>

<p>I seated myself, and he went on.</p>

<p>"The events of the last two days must have
made such an impression on your mind that even
the most remarkable incidents of your life could
not compete with. You fancied yourself a great
discoverer, and that, by the happy conjuncture
of intelligence and accident, you had actually
fathomed the depths of that wonderful system of
police, which, more powerful than armies or
councils, is the real government of France! I
will not stop now to convince you that you have
not wandered out of the very shallowest channels
of this system. It is enough that you have been
admitted to an audience with me, to suggest an
opposite conviction, and give to your recital,
when you repeat the tale, a species of importance.
Now, sir, my counsel to you is, never to repeat
it, and for this reason; nobody possessed of common
powers of judgment will ever believe you!
not one, sir! No one would ever believe that
Monsieur Fouch&eacute; had made so grave a mistake,
no more than he would believe that a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
good name and birth, a French officer, could have
stolen a snuff-box. You see, Monsieur de Tiernay,
that I acquit you of this shameful act.
Imitate my generosity, sir, and forget all that
you have witnessed since Tuesday last. I have
given you good advice, sir; if I find that you
profit by it, we may see more of each other."</p>

<p>Scarcely appreciating the force of his parable,
and thinking of nothing save the vindication of
my honor, I muttered a few unmeaning words,
and withdrew, glad to escape a presence which
had assumed, to my terrified senses, all the
diabolical subtlety of satanic influence. Trusting
that no future accident of my life should
ever bring me within such precincts, I hurried
from the place as though it were contaminated
and plague-stricken.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVII.</h3>

<h4>"THE VILLAGE OF SCHWARTZ-ACH."</h4>


<p>I was destitute enough when I quitted the
"Temple," a few days back; but my condition
now was sadder still, for in addition to my
poverty and friendlessness, I had imbibed a degree
of distrust and suspicion that made me shun
my fellow-men, and actually shrink from the
contact of a stranger. The commonest show of
courtesy, the most ordinary exercise of politeness,
struck me as the secret wiles of that police,
whose machinations, I fancied, were still spread
around me. I had conceived a most intense
hatred of civilization, or, at least, of what I
rashly supposed to be the inherent vices of civilized
life. I longed for what I deemed must be
the glorious independence of a savage. If I
could but discover this Paradise beyond seas, of
which the marquise raved so much; if I only
could find out that glorious land which neither
knew secret intrigues nor conspiracies, I should
leave France forever, taking any condition, or
braving any mischances fate might have in store
for me.</p>

<p>There was something peculiarly offensive in
the treatment I had met with. Imprisoned on
suspicion, I was liberated without any "amende;"
neither punished like a guilty man, nor absolved
as an innocent one. I was sent out upon the
world as though the state would not own nor
acknowledge me; a dangerous practice, as I often
thought, if only adopted on a large scale. It was
some days before I could summon resolution to
ascertain exactly my position: at last I did muster
up courage, and under pretense of wishing to
address a letter to myself, I applied at the Ministry
of War for the address of Lieutenant Tiernay,
of the 9th Hussars. I was one of a large crowd
similarly engaged, some inquiring for sons that
had fallen in battle, or husbands or fathers in far
away countries. The office was only open each
morning for two hours, and consequently, as the
expiration of the time drew nigh, the eagerness
of the inquirers became far greater, and the contrast
with the cold apathy of the clerks the more
strongly marked. I had given way to many, who
were weaker than myself, and less able to buffet
with the crowd about them; and at last, when,
wearied by waiting, I was drawing nigh the table,
my attention was struck by an old, a very old
man, who, with a beard white as snow, and long
mustaches of the same color, was making great
efforts to gain the front rank. I stretched out
my hand, and caught his, and by considerable exertion,
at last succeeded in placing him in front
of me.</p>

<p>He thanked me fervently, in a strange kind
of German, a <i>patois</i> I had never heard before,
and kissed my hand three or four times over in
his gratitude; indeed, so absorbed was he for
the time in his desire to thank me, that I had to
recall him to the more pressing reason of his
presence, and warn him that but a few minutes
more of the hour remained free.</p>

<p>"Speak up," cried the clerk, as the old man
muttered something in a low and very indistinct
voice; "speak up; and remember, my friend,
that we do not profess to give information further
back than the times of 'Louis Quatorze.'"</p>

<p>This allusion to the years of the old man was
loudly applauded by his colleagues, who drew
nigh to stare at the cause of it.</p>

<p>"Sacre bleu! he is talking Hebrew," said
another, "and asking for a friend who fell at
Ramoth Gilead."</p>

<p>"He is speaking German," said I, peremptorily,
"and asking for a relative whom he believes
to have embarked with the expedition to
Egypt."</p>

<p>"Are you a sworn interpreter, young man?"
asked an older and more consequential-looking
personage.</p>

<p>I was about to return a hasty reply to this impertinence,
but I thought of the old man, and the
few seconds that still remained for his inquiry,
and I smothered my anger, and was silent.</p>

<p>"What rank did he hold?" inquired one of
the clerks, who had listened with rather more
patience to the old man. I translated the question
for the peasant, who, in reply, confessed
that he could not tell. The youth was his only
son, and had left home many years before, and
never written. A neighbor, however, who had
traveled in foreign parts, had brought tidings
that he had gone with the expedition to Egypt,
and was already high in the French army.</p>

<p>"You are not quite certain that he did not
command the army of Egypt?" said one of the
clerks in mockery of the old man's story.</p>

<p>"It is not unlikely," said the peasant gravely,
"he was a brave and bold youth, and could have
lifted two such as you with one hand and hurled
you out of that window."</p>

<p>"Let us hear his name once more," said the
elder clerk; "it is worth remembering."</p>

<p>"I have told you already. It was Karl Kleber."</p>

<p>"The General&mdash;General Kleber!" cried three
or four in a breath.</p>

<p>"Mayhap," was all the reply.</p>

<p>"And are you the father of the great general
of Egypt?" asked the elder, with an air of deep
respect.</p>

<p>"Kleber is my son; and so that he is alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and well, I care little if a general or simple
soldier."</p>

<p>Not a word was said in answer to this speech,
and each seemed to feel reluctant to tell the sad
tidings. At last the elder clerk said, "You
have lost a good son, and France one of her
greatest captains. The General Kleber is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead!" said the old man, slowly.</p>

<p>"In the very moment of his greatest glory,
too, when he had won the country of the Pyramids,
and made Egypt a colony of France."</p>

<p>"When did he die? said the peasant.</p>

<p>"The last accounts from the East brought the
news; and this very day the Council of State
has accorded a pension to his family of ten thousand
livres."</p>

<p>"They may keep their money. I am all that
remains, and have no want of it; and I should
be poorer still before I'd take it."</p>

<p>These words he uttered in a low, harsh tone,
and pushed his way back though the crowd.</p>

<p>One moment more was enough for <i>my</i> inquiry.</p>

<p>"Maurice Tiernay, of the 9th&mdash;<i>destitu&eacute;</i>," was
the short and stunning answer I received.</p>

<p>"Is there any reason alleged&mdash;is there any
charge imputed to him?" asked I, timidly.</p>

<p>"Ma foi! you must go to the Minister of
War with that question. Perhaps he was pay-master,
and embezzled the funds of the regiment;
perhaps he liked royalist gold better than republican
silver; or perhaps he preferred the company
of the baggage-train and the 'ambulances,'
when he should have been at the head of his
squadron."</p>

<p>I did not care to listen longer to this impertinence,
and making my way out I gained the
street. The old peasant was still standing there,
like one stunned and overwhelmed by some
great shock, and neither heeding the crowd that
passed, nor the groups that halted occasionally
to stare at him.</p>

<p>"Come along with <i>me</i>," said I, taking his
hand in mine. "<i>Your</i> calamity is a heavy one,
but <i>mine</i> is harder to bear up against."</p>

<p>He suffered himself to be led away like a
child, and never spoke a word as we walked
along toward the "barriere," beyond which, at
a short distance, was a little ordinary, where I
used to dine. There we had our dinner together,
and as the evening wore on the old man rallied
enough to tell me of his son's early life, and
his departure for the army. Of his great career
<i>I</i> could speak freely, for Kleber's name was, in
soldier esteem, scarcely second to that of Bonaparte
himself. Not all the praises I could bestow,
however, were sufficient to turn the old
man from his stern conviction, that a peasant in
the "Lech Thal" was a more noble and independent
man than the greatest general that ever
marched to victory.</p>

<p>"We have been some centuries there," said
he, "and none of our name has incurred a
shadow of disgrace. Why should not Karl have
lived like his ancestors?"</p>

<p>It was useless to appeal to the glory his son
had gained&mdash;the noble reputation he had left
behind him. The peasant saw in the soldier
but one who hired out his courage and his blood,
and deemed the calling a low and unworthy one.
I suppose I was not the first who, in the effort
to convince another, found himself shaken in his
own convictions; for I own before I lay down
that night many of the old man's arguments
assumed a force and power that I could not resist,
and held possession of my mind even after
I fell asleep. In my dreams I was once more
beside the American lake, and that little colony
of simple people, where I had seen all that was
best of my life, and learned the few lessons I had
ever received of charity and good-nature.</p>

<p>From what the peasant said, the primitive
habits of the Lech Thal must be almost like
those of that little colony, and I willingly assented
to his offer to accompany him in his journey
homeward. He seemed to feel a kind of satisfaction
in turning my thoughts away from a
career that he held so cheaply, and talked enthusiastically
of the tranquil life of the Bregenzer-wald.</p>

<p>We left Paris the following morning, and,
partly by diligence, partly on foot, reached Strassburg
in a few days; thence we proceeded by
Kehel to Freyburg, and, crossing the Lake of
Constance at Rorsbach, we entered the Bregenzer-wald
on the twelfth morning of our journey.
I suppose that most men preserve fresher memory
of the stirring and turbulent scenes of their
lives than of the more peaceful and tranquil
ones, and I shall not be deemed singular when
I say, that some years passed over me in this
quiet spot and seemed as but a few weeks. The
old peasant was the "Vorsteher," or ruler of the
village, by whom all disputes were settled, and
all litigation of an humble kind decided&mdash;a species
of voluntary jurisdiction maintained to this
very day in that primitive region. My occupation
there was as a species of secretary to the
court, an office quite new to the villagers, but
which served to impress them more reverentially
than ever in favor of this rude justice. My legal
duties over, I became a vine-dresser, a wood-cutter,
or a deer-stalker, as season and weather
dictated. My evenings being always devoted to
the task of a schoolmaster. A curious seminary
was it, too, embracing every class from childhood
to advanced age, all eager for knowledge,
and all submitting to the most patient discipline
to attain it. There was much to make me happy
in that humble lot. I had the love and esteem
of all around me; there was neither a harassing
doubt for the future, nor the rich man's
contumely to oppress me; my life was made up
of occupations which alternately engaged mind
and body, and, above all and worth all besides,
I had a sense of duty, a feeling that I was doing
that which was useful to my fellow-men; and
however great may be a man's station in life, if
it want this element, the humblest peasant that
rises to his daily toil has a nobler and a better part.</p>

<p>As I trace these lines how many memories of
the spot are rising before me! Scenes I had
long forgotten&mdash;faces I had ceased to remember!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
And now I see the little wooden bridge&mdash;a giant
tree, guarded by a single rail, that crossed the
torrent in front of our cottage; and I behold once
more the little waxen image of the Virgin over
the door, in whose glass shrine at nightfall a candle
ever burned! and I hear the low hum of the
villagers' prayer as the Angelus is singing, and
see on every crag or cliff the homebound hunter
kneeling in his deep devotion!</p>

<p>Happy people, and not less good than happy!
Your bold and barren mountains have been the
safeguard of your virtue and your innocence!
Long may they prove so, and long may the waves
of the world's ambition be staid at their rocky feet!</p>

<p>I was beginning to forget all that I had seen
of life, or, if not forget, at least to regard it as a
wild and troubled dream, when an accident, one
of those things we always regard as the merest
chances, once more opened the flood-gates of
memory, and sent the whole past in a strong
current through my brain.</p>

<p>In this mountain region the transition from
winter to summer is effected in a few days.
Some hours of a scorching sun and south wind
swell the torrents with melted snow; the icebergs
fall thundering from cliff and crag, and
the sporting waterfall once more dashes over the
precipice. The trees burst into leaf, and the
grass springs up green and fresh from its wintry
covering; and from the dreary aspect of snow-capped
hills and leaden clouds, nature changes
to fertile plains and hills, and a sky of almost
unbroken blue.</p>

<p>It was on a glorious evening in April, when
all these changes were passing, that I was descending
the mountain above our village after a
hard day's chamois hunting. Anxious to reach
the plain before nightfall, I could not, however,
help stopping from time to time to watch the
golden and ruby tints of the sun upon the snow,
or see the turquoise blue which occasionally
marked the course of a rivulet through the glaciers.
The Alp-horn was sounding from every
cliff and height, and the lowing of the cattle
swelled into a rich and mellow chorus. It was
a beautiful picture, realizing in every tint and
hue, in every sound and cadence, all that one
can fancy of romantic simplicity, and I surveyed
it with a swelling and a grateful heart.</p>

<p>As I turned to resume my way, I was struck
by the sound of voices speaking, as I fancied, in
French, and before I could settle the doubt with
myself, I saw in front of me a party of some six
or seven soldiers, who, with their muskets slung
behind them, were descending the steep path by
the aid of sticks.</p>

<p>Weary-looking and foot-sore as they were,
their dress, their bearing, and their soldier-like
air, struck me forcibly, and sent into my heart
a thrill I had not known for many a day before.
I came up quickly behind them, and could overhear
their complaints at having mistaken the
road, and their maledictions, muttered in no gentle
spirit, on the stupid mountaineers who could
not understand French.</p>

<p>"Here comes another fellow, let us try <i>him</i>,"
said one, as he turned and saw me near.
"Schwartz-Ach, Schwartz-Ach," added he, addressing
me, and reading the name from a slip
of paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"I am going to the village," said I, in French,
"and will show the way with pleasure."</p>

<p>"How! what! are you a Frenchman, then?"
cried the corporal, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Even so," said I.</p>

<p>"Then by what chance are you living in this
wild spot? How, in the name of wonder, can
you exist here?"</p>

<p>"With venison like this," said I, pointing to
a chamois buck on my shoulder, "and the red
wine of the Lech Thal, a man may manage to
forget Veray's and the "Dragon Vert," particularly
as they are not associated with a bill and a
waiter!"</p>

<p>"And perhaps you are a royalist," cried another,
"and don't like how matters are going on
at home?"</p>

<p>"I have not that excuse for my exile," said I,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Have you served, then?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," said the corporal, "you grew
weary of parade and guard mounting."</p>

<p>"If you mean that I deserted," said I, "you are
wrong there also; and now let it be my turn to ask
a few questions. What is France about? Is the
Republic still as great and victorious as ever?"</p>

<p>"Sacre bleu, man, what are you thinking of?
We are an Empire some years back, and Napoleon
has made as many kings as he has got
brothers and cousins to crown."</p>

<p>"And the army, where is it?"</p>

<p>"Ask for some half dozen armies, and you'll
still be short of the mark. We have one in Hamburg,
and another in the far North, holding the
Russians in check; we have garrisons in every
fortress of Prussia and the Rhine Land; we
have some eighty thousand fellows in Poland
and Gallicia; double as many more in Spain;
Italy is our own, and so will be Austria ere
many days go over."</p>

<p>Boastfully as all this was spoken, I found it to
be not far from truth, and learned, as we walked
along, that the emperor was, at that very moment,
on the march to meet the Archduke Charles,
who, with a numerous army, was advancing on
Ratisbon, the little party of soldiers being portion
of a force dispatched to explore the passes
of the "Voralberg," and report on how far they
might be practicable for the transmission of troops
to act on the left flank and rear of the Austrian
army. Their success had up to this time been
very slight, and the corporal was making for
Schwartz-Ach, as a spot where he hoped to rendezvous
with some of his comrades. They were
much disappointed on my telling them that I had
quitted the village that morning, and that not a
soldier had been seen there. There was, however,
no other spot to pass the night in, and they
willingly accepted the offer I made them of a

<h2>VAGARIES OF THE IMAGINATION.</h2>


<p>"Fancy it burgundy," said Boniface of his
ale, "only fancy it, and it is worth a guinea
a quart!" Boniface was a philosopher: fancy
can do much more than that. Those who fancy
themselves laboring under an affection of the
heart are not slow in verifying the apprehension:
the uneasy and constant watching of its pulsations
soon disturbs the circulation, and malady
may ensue beyond the power of medicine. Some
physicians believe that inflammation can be induced
in any part of the body by a fearful attention
being continually directed toward it; indeed
it has been a question with some whether the
stigmata (the marks of the wounds of our Saviour)
may not have been produced on the devotee by
the influences of an excited imagination. The
hypochondriac has been known to expire when
forced to pass through a door which he fancied
too narrow to admit his person. The story of
the criminal who, unconscious of the arrival of
the reprieve, died under the stroke of a wet handkerchief,
believing it to be the ax, is well known.
Paracelsus held, "that there is in man an imagination
which really effects and brings to pass
the things that did not before exist; for a man
by imagination willing to move his body moves
it in fact, and by his imagination and the commerce
of invisible powers he may also move another
body." Paracelsus would not have been
surprised at the feats of electro-biology. He exhorts
his patients to have "a good faith, a strong
imagination, and they shall find the effects. All
doubt," he says, "destroys work, and leaves it
imperfect in the wise designs of nature; it is
from faith that imagination draws its strength, it
is by faith it becomes complete and realized; he
who believeth in nature will obtain from nature to
the extent of his faith, and let the object of this faith
be real or imaginary, he nevertheless reaps similar
results&mdash;and hence the cause of superstition."</p>

<p>So early as 1462, Pomponatus of Mantua came
to the conclusion, in his work on incantation,
that all the arts of sorcery and witchcraft were
the result of natural operations. He conceived
that it was not improbable that external means,
called into action by the soul, might relieve our
sufferings, and that there did, moreover, exist individuals
endowed with salutary properties; so it
might, therefore, be easily conceived that marvelous
effects should be produced by the imagination
and by confidence, more especially when these
are reciprocal between the patient and the person
who assists his recovery. Two years after, the
same opinion was advanced by Agrippa in Cologne.
"The soul," he said, "if inflamed by a
fervent imagination, could dispense health and
disease, not only in the individual himself, but
in other bodies." However absurd these opinions
may have been considered, or looked on as enthusiastic,
the time has come when they will be
gravely examined.</p>

<p>That medical professors have at all times believed
the imagination to possess a strange and
powerful influence over mind and body is proved
by their writings, by some of their prescriptions,
and by their oft-repeated direction in the sick-chamber
to divert the patient's mind from dwelling
on his own state and from attending to the
symptoms of his complaint. They consider the
reading of medical books which accurately describe
the symptoms of various complaints as
likely to have an injurious effect, not only on the
delicate but on persons in full health; and they
are conscious how many died during the time of
the plague and cholera, not only of these diseases
but from the dread of them, which brought on all
the fatal symptoms. So evident was the effect
produced by the detailed accounts of the cholera
in the public papers in the year 1849, that it was
found absolutely necessary to restrain the publications
on the subject. The illusions under which
vast numbers acted and suffered have gone, indeed,
to the most extravagant extent: individuals,
not merely singly but in communities, have actually
believed in their own transformation. A
nobleman of the court of Louis XIV. fancied
himself a dog, and would pop his head out of the
window to bark at the passengers; while the
barking disease at the camp-meetings of the
Methodists of North America has been described
as "extravagant beyond belief." Rollin and
Hecquet have recorded a malady by which the
inmates of an extensive convent near Paris were
attacked simultaneously every day at the same
hour, when they believed themselves transformed
into cats, and a universal mewing was kept up
throughout the convent for some hours. But of
all dreadful forms which this strange hallucination
took, none was so terrible as that of the
lycanthropy, which at one period spread through
Europe; in which the unhappy sufferers, believing
themselves wolves, went prowling about the
forests, uttering the most terrific howlings, carrying
off lambs from the flocks, and gnawing
dead bodies in their graves.</p>

<p>While every day's experience adds some new
proof of the influence possessed by the imagination
over the body, the supposed effect of contagion
has become a question of doubt. Lately,
at a meeting in Edinburgh, Professor Dick gave
it as his opinion that there was no such thing as
hydrophobia in the lower animals: "what went
properly by that name was simply an inflammation
of the brain; and the disease, in the case of
human beings, was caused by an over-excited imagination,
worked upon by the popular delusion on
the effects of a bite by rabid animals." The following
paragraph from the "Curiosities of Medicine"
appears to justify this now common enough
opinion:&mdash;"Several persons had been bitten by
a rabid dog in the Faubourg St. Antoine, and
three of them had died in our hospital. A report,
however, was prevalent that we kept a mixture
which would effectually prevent the fatal termination;
and no less than six applicants who
had been bitten were served with a draught of
colored water, and in no one instance did hydrophobia
ensue."</p>

<p>A remarkable cure through a similar aid of the
imagination took place in a patient of Dr. Beddoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
who was at the time very sanguine about
the effect of nitrous acid gas in paralytic cases.
Anxious that it should be imbibed by one of his
patients, he sent an invalid to Sir Humphry Davy,
with a request that he would administer the gas.
Sir Humphry put the bulb of the thermometer
under the tongue of the paralytic, to ascertain
the temperature of the body, that he might be
sure whether it would be affected at all by the
inhalation of the gas. The patient, full of faith
from what the enthusiastic physician had assured
him would be the result, and believing that the
thermometer was what was to effect the cure,
exclaimed at once that he felt better. Sir Humphry,
anxious to see what imagination would do
in such a case, did not attempt to undeceive the
man, but saying that he had done enough for
him that day, desired him to be with him the
next morning. The thermometer was then applied
as it had been the day before, and for every
day during a fortnight&mdash;at the end of which time
the patient was perfectly cured.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing on record more curious
of this kind than the cures unwittingly performed
by Chief-justice Holt. It seems that for a youthful
frolic he and his companions had put up at a
country inn; they, however, found themselves
without the means of defraying their expenses,
and were at a loss to know what they should do
in such an emergency. Holt, however, perceived
that the innkeeper's daughter looked very ill, and
on inquiring what was the matter, learned that
she had the ague; when, passing himself off for
a medical student, he said that he had an infallible
cure for the complaint. He then collected a
number of plants, mixed them up with various
ceremonies, and inclosed them in parchment, on
which he scrawled divers cabalistic characters.
When all was completed, he suspended the amulet
round the neck of the young woman, and, strange
to say, the ague left her and never returned. The
landlord, grateful for the restoration of his daughter,
not only declined receiving any payment from
the youths, but pressed them to remain as long
as they pleased. Many years after, when Holt
was on the bench, a woman was brought before
him, charged with witchcraft: she was accused
of curing the ague by charms. All she said in
defense was, that she did possess a ball which
was a sovereign remedy in the complaint. The
charm was produced and handed to the judge,
who recognized the very ball which he had himself
compounded in his boyish days, when out
of mere fun he had assumed the character of a
medical practitioner.</p>

<p>Many distinguished physicians have candidly
confessed that they preferred confidence to art.
Faith in the remedy is often not only half the
cure, but the whole cure. Madame de Genlis
tells of a girl who had lost the use of her leg for
five years, and could only move with the help of
crutches, while her back had to be supported:
she was in such a pitiable state of weakness, the
physicians had pronounced her case incurable.
She, however, took it into her head that if she
was taken to Notre Dame de Liesse she would
certainly recover. It was fifteen leagues from
Carlepont where she lived. She was placed in
a cart which her father drove, while her sister
sat by her supporting her back. The moment
the steeple of Notre Dame de Liesse was in sight
she uttered an exclamation, and said that her leg
was getting well. She alighted from the car
without assistance, and no longer requiring the
help of her crutches, she ran into the church.
When she returned home the villagers gathered
about her, scarcely believing that it was indeed
the girl who had left them in such a wretched
state, now they saw her running and bounding
along, no longer a cripple, but as active as any
among them.</p>

<p>Not less extraordinary are the cures which are
effected by some sudden agitation. An alarm of
fire has been known to restore a patient entirely
or for a time, from a tedious illness: it is no uncommon
thing to hear of the victim of a severe fit
of the gout, whose feet have been utterly powerless,
running nimbly away from some approaching
danger. Poor Grimaldi in his declining years
had almost quite lost the use of his limbs owing
to the most hopeless debility. As he sat one day
by the bed side of his wife, who was ill, word
was brought to him that a friend waited below
to see him. He got down to the parlor with extreme
difficulty. His friend was the bearer of
heavy news which he dreaded to communicate:
it was the death of Grimaldi's son, who, though
reckless and worthless, was fondly loved by the
poor father. The intelligence was broken as
gently as such a sad event could be: but in an
instant Grimaldi sprung from his chair&mdash;his lassitude
and debility were gone, his breathing,
which had for a long time been difficult, became
perfectly easy&mdash;he was hardly a moment in bounding
up the stairs which but a quarter of an hour
before he had passed with extreme difficulty in
ten minutes; he reached the bed-side, and told
his wife that their son was dead; and as she
burst into an agony of grief he flung himself into
a chair, and became again instantaneously, as it
has been touchingly described, "an enfeebled and
crippled old man."</p>

<p>The imagination, which is remarkable for its
ungovernable influence, comes into action on
some occasions periodically with the most precise
regularity. A friend once told us of a young
relation who was subject to nervous attacks: she
was spending some time at the sea-side for change
of air, but the evening-gun, fired from the vessel
in the bay at eight o'clock, was always the signal
for a nervous attack: the instant the report was
heard she fell back insensible, as if she had been
shot. Those about her endeavored if possible to
withdraw her thoughts from the expected moment:
at length one evening they succeeded, and
while she was engaged in an interesting conversation
the evening-gun was unnoticed. By-and-by
she asked the hour, and appeared uneasy when
she found the time had passed. The next evening
it was evident that she would not let her
attention be withdrawn: the gun fired, and she
swooned away: and when revived, another fainting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
fit succeeded, as if it were to make up for the
omission of the preceding evening! It is told of
the great tragic actress Clairon, who had been
the innocent cause of the suicide of a man who
destroyed himself by a pistol-shot, that ever after,
at the exact moment when the fatal deed had
been perpetrated&mdash;one o'clock in the morning&mdash;she
heard the shot. If asleep, it awakened her;
if engaged in conversation, it interrupted her; in
solitude or in company, at home or traveling, in
the midst of revelry or at her devotions, she was
sure to hear it to the very moment.</p>

<p>The same indelible impression has been made
in hundreds of cases, and on persons of every
variety of temperament and every pursuit, whether
engaged in business, science, or art, or rapt in
holy contemplation. On one occasion Pascal
had been thrown down on a bridge which had no
parapet, and his imagination was so haunted forever
after by the danger, that he always fancied
himself on the brink of a steep precipice overhanging
an abyss ready to engulf him. This
illusion had taken such possession of his mind
that the friends who came to converse with him
were obliged to place the chairs on which they
seated themselves between him and the fancied
danger. But the effects of terror are the best
known of all the vagaries of imagination.</p>

<p>A very remarkable case of the influence of imagination
occurred between sixty and seventy
years since in Dublin, connected with the celebrated
frolics of Dalkey Island. It is said Curran
and his gay companions delighted to spend a day
there, and that with them originated the frolic
of electing "a king of Dalkey and the adjacent
islands," and appointing his chancellor and all
the officers of state. A man in the middle rank
of life, universally respected, and remarkable
alike for kindly and generous feelings and a convivial
spirit, was unanimously elected to fill the
throne. He entered with his whole heart into
all the humors of the pastime, in which the citizens
of Dublin so long delighted. A journal was
kept, called the "Dalkey Gazette," in which all
public proceedings were inserted, and it afforded
great amusement to its conductors. But the mock
pageantry, the affected loyalty, and the pretended
homage of his subjects, at length began to excite
the imagination of "King John," as he was called.
Fiction at length became with him reality, and he
fancied himself "every inch a king." His family
and friends perceived with dismay and deep sorrow
the strange delusion which nothing could
shake: he would speak on no subject save the
kingdom of Dalkey and its government, and he
loved to dwell on the various projects he had in
contemplation for the benefit of his people, and
boasted of his high prerogative: he never could
conceive himself divested for one moment of his
royal powers, and exacted the most profound
deference to his kingly authority. The last year
and a half of his life were spent in Swift's hospital
for lunatics. He felt his last hours approaching,
but no gleam of returning reason
marked the parting scene: to the very last instant
he believed himself a king, and all his cares
and anxieties were for his people. He spoke in
high terms of his chancellor, his attorney-general,
and all his officers of state, and of the dignitaries
of the church: he recommended them to his kingdom,
and trusted they might all retain the high
offices which they now held. He spoke on the
subject with a dignified calmness well becoming
the solemn leave-taking of a monarch; but when
he came to speak of the crown he was about to
relinquish forever his feelings were quite overcome,
and the tears rolled down his cheeks: "I
leave it," said he, "to my people, and to him
whom they may elect as my successor!" This
remarkable scene is recorded in some of the
notices of deaths for the year 1788. The delusion,
though most painful to his friends, was far
from an unhappy one to its victim: his feelings
were gratified to the last while thinking he was
occupied with the good of his fellow-creatures&mdash;an
occupation best suited to his benevolent disposition.</p>

<h2>MYSTERIES!</h2>


<p>"I believe nothing that I do not understand,"
is the favorite saying of Mr. Pettipo
Dapperling, a gentleman who very much
prides himself on his intellectual perspicacity.
Yet ask Mr. Pettipo if he understands how it is
that he wags his little finger, and he can give
you no reasonable account of it. He will tell
you (for he has read books and "studied" anatomy),
that the little finger consists of so many
jointed bones, that there are tendons attached
to them before and behind, which belong to certain
muscles, and that when these muscles are
made to contract, the finger wags. And this is
nearly all that Mr. Pettipo knows about it! How
it is that the volition acts on the muscles, what
volition is, what the will is&mdash;Mr. Pettipo knows
not. He knows quite as little about the Sensation
which resides in the skin of that little finger&mdash;how
it is that it feels and appreciates forms
and surfaces&mdash;why it detects heat and cold&mdash;in
what way its papill&aelig; erect themselves, and its
pores open and close&mdash;about all this he is entirely
in the dark. And yet Mr. Pettipo is under
the necessity of believing that his little finger
wags, and that it is endowed with the gift of
sensation, though he in fact knows nothing whatever
of the why or the wherefore.</p>

<p>We must believe a thousand things that we
can not understand. Matter and its combinations
are a grand mystery&mdash;how much more so, Life
and its manifestations. Look at those far-off
worlds majestically wheeling in their appointed
orbits, millions of miles off: or, look at this
earth on which we live, performing its diurnal
motion upon its own axis, and its annual circle
round the sun! What do we understand of the
causes of such motions? what can we ever know
about them, beyond the facts that such things
are so? To discover and apprehend facts is
much, and it is nearly our limit. To ultimate
causes we can never ascend. But to have an
eye open to receive facts and apprehend their
relative value&mdash;that is a great deal&mdash;that is our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
duty; and not to reject, suspect, or refuse to accept
them, because they happen to clash with
our preconceived notions, or, like Mr. Pettipo Dapperling,
because we "can not understand" them.</p>

<p>"O, my dear Kepler!" writes Galileo to his
friend, "how I wish that we could have one
hearty laugh together! Here at Padua is the
principal Professor of Philosophy, whom I have
repeatedly and urgently requested to look at the
moon and planets through my glass, which he
pertinaciously refuses to do. Why are you not
here? What shouts of laughter we should have
at this glorious folly! And to hear the Professor
of Philosophy at Pisa lecturing before the
Grand Duke with logical arguments, as if with
magical incantations to charm the new planets
out of the sky!"</p>

<p>Rub a stick of wax against your coat-sleeve,
and it emits sparks: hold it near to light, fleecy
particles of wool or cotton, and it first attracts,
then it repels them. What do you understand
about that, Mr. Pettipo, except merely that it is
so? Stroke the cat's back before the fire, and
you will observe the same phenomena. Your
own body will, in like manner, emit sparks in
certain states, but you know nothing about why
it is so.</p>

<p>Pour a solution of muriate of lime into one of
sulphate of potash&mdash;both clear fluids; but no
sooner are they mixed together than they become
nearly solid. How is that? You tell me that
an ingredient of the one solution combines with
an ingredient of the other, and an insoluble sulphate
of lime is produced. Well! you tell me
a fact; but you do not account for it by saying
that the lime has a greater attraction for the sulphuric
acid than the potash has: you do not
<i>understand</i> how it is&mdash;you merely see that it is
so. You must believe it.</p>

<p>But when you come to Life, and its wonderful
manifestations, you are more in the dark than
ever. You understand less about this than you
do even of dead matter. Take an ordinary every-day
fact: you drop two seeds, whose component
parts are the same, into the same soil. They
grow up so close together that their roots mingle
and their stalks intertwine. The one plant produces
a long slender leaf, the other a short flat
leaf&mdash;the one brings forth a beautiful flower, the
other an ugly scruff&mdash;the one sheds abroad a delicious
fragrance, the other is entirely inodorous.
The hemlock, the wheatstalk, and the rose-tree,
out of the same chemical ingredients contained
in the soil, educe, the one deadly poison, the other
wholesome food, the third a bright consummate
flower. Can you tell me, Mr. Pettipo, how
is this? Do you understand the secret by which
the roots of these plants accomplish so much
more than all your science can do, and so infinitely
excel the most skillful combinations of the
philosopher? You can only recognize the fact&mdash;but
you can not unravel the mystery. Your saying
that it is the "nature" of the plants, does not
in the slightest degree clear up the difficulty.
You can not get at the ultimate fact&mdash;only the
proximate one is seen by you.</p>

<p>But lo! here is a wonderful little plant&mdash;touch
it, and the leaves shrink on the instant: one leaf
seeming to be in intimate sympathy with the rest,
and the whole leaves in its neighborhood shrinking
up at the touch of a foreign object. Or, take
the simple pimpernel, which closes its eye as the
sun goes down, and opens as he rises again&mdash;shrinks
at the approach of rain, and expands in
fair weather. The hop twines round the pole in
the direction of the sun, and&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sunflower turns on her god when he sets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same look that she turned when he rose."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Do we know any thing about these things,
further than they are so?</p>

<p>A partridge chick breaks its shell and steps
forth into its new world. Instantly it runs about
and picks up the seeds lying about on the ground.
It had never learned to run, or to see, or to select
its food; but it does all these on the instant.
The lamb of a few hours' old frisks about full of
life, and sucks its dam's teat with as much accuracy
as if it had studied the principle of the air-pump.
Instinct comes full-grown into the world
at once, and we know nothing about it, neither
does the Mr. Dapperling above named.</p>

<p>When we ascend to the higher orders of animated
being&mdash;to man himself&mdash;we are as much
in the dark as before&mdash;perhaps more so. Here
we have matter arranged in its most highly-organized
forms&mdash;moving, feeling, and thinking.
In man the animal powers are concentrated; and
the thinking powers are brought to their highest
point. How, by the various arrangements of
matter in man's body, one portion of the nervous
system should convey volitions from the brain to
the limbs and the outer organs&mdash;how another
part should convey sensations with the suddenness
of lightning&mdash;and how, finally, a third portion
should collect these sensations, react upon
them, store them up by a process called Memory,
reproduce them in thought, compare them, philosophize
upon them, embody them in books&mdash;is
a great and unfathomable mystery!</p>

<p>Life itself! how wonderful it is! Who can
understand it, or unravel its secret! From a
tiny vesicle, at first almost imperceptible to the
eye, but gradually growing and accumulating
about it fresh materials, which are in turns organized
and laid down, each in their set places,
at length a body is formed, becomes developed&mdash;passing
through various inferior stages of being&mdash;those
of polype, fish, frog, and animal&mdash;until,
at length, the human being rises above all these
forms, and the law of the human animal life is
fulfilled. First, he is merely instinctive, then
sensitive, then reflective&mdash;the last the greatest,
the crowning work of man's development. But
what do we <i>know</i> of it all? Do we not merely
see that it is so, and turn aside from the great
mystery in despair of ever unraveling it?</p>

<p>The body sleeps? Volition, sensation, and
thought, become suspended for a time, while the
animal powers live on; capillary arteries working,
heart beating, lungs playing, all without an
effort&mdash;voluntarily and spontaneously. The
shadow of some recent thought agitates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
brain, and the sleeper dreams. Or, his volition
may awake, while sensation is still profoundly
asleep, and then we have the somnambule, walking
in his sleep. Or, volition may be profoundly
asleep, while the senses are preternaturally excited,
as in the abnormal mesmeric state. Here
we have a new class of phenomena, more wonderful
because less usual, but not a whit more
mysterious than the most ordinary manifestations
of life.</p>

<p>We are astonished to hear men refusing to
credit the evidence of their senses as to mesmeric
phenomena, on the ground that they can not
"understand" them. When they can not understand
the commonest manifestations of life&mdash;the
causation of volition, sensation, or thought&mdash;why
should they refuse belief on such a ground? Are
the facts real? Are these things so? This should
be the chief consideration with us. Mysteries
they may be; but all life, all matter, all that is,
are mysteries too. Do we refuse to believe in
the electric telegraph, because the instantaneous
transmission of intelligence between points a
thousand miles apart seems at first sight fabulous,
and, to the uninitiated, profoundly mysterious?
Why should not thought&mdash;the most wonderful
and subtle of known agencies&mdash;manifest
itself in equally extraordinary ways?</p>

<p>We do not know that what the mesmerists call
<i>clairvoyance</i> is yet to be held as established by
sufficient evidence. Numerous strongly authenticated
cases have certainly been adduced by persons
whose evidence is above suspicion&mdash;as, for
instance, by Swedenborg (attested by many impartial
witnesses), by Goethe, by Zschokke, by
Townshend, by Martineau, and others; but the
evidence seems still to want confirmation. Only,
we say, let us not prejudge the case&mdash;let us wait
patiently for all sorts of evidence. We can not
argue <i>&agrave; priori</i> that <i>clairvoyance</i> is not true, any
more than the Professor at Padua could argue,
with justice, that the worlds which Galileo's
telescope revealed in the depths of space, were
all a sham. That truth was established by extended
observation. Let us wait and see whether
this may not yet be established, too, by similar
means.</p>

<p>Some of the things which the mesmerists, who
go the length of <i>clairvoyance</i>, tell us, certainly
have a very mysterious look; and were not sensation,
thought, and all the manifestations of Life
(not yet half investigated) all alike mysterious,
we might be disposed to shut our eyes with the
rest, and say we refused to believe, because we
"did not understand."</p>

<p>But equally extraordinary relations to the same
effect have been made by men who were neither
mesmerists nor clairvoyantes. For instance,
Kant, the German writer, relates that Swedenborg
once, when living at Gottenburg, some three
hundred miles from Stockholm, suddenly rose up
and went out, when at the house of one Kostel,
in the company of fifteen persons. After a few
minutes he returned, pale and alarmed, and informed
the party that a dangerous fire had just
broken out in Stockholm, in Sudermalm, and that
the fire was spreading fast. He was restless, and
went out often; he said that the house of one
of his friends, whom he named, was already in
ashes, and that his own was in danger. At eight
o'clock, after he had been out again, he joyfully
exclaimed, "Thank God, the fire is extinguished
the third door from my house." This statement
of Swedenborg's spread through the town, and
occasioned consternation and wonder. The governor
heard of it, and sent for Swedenborg, who
described the particulars of the fire&mdash;where and
how it had begun, in what manner it had ceased,
and how long it had continued. On the Monday
evening, two days after the fire, a messenger arrived
from Gottenburg, who had been dispatched
during the time of the fire, and the intelligence
he brought confirmed all that Swedenborg had
said as to its commencement: and on the following
morning the royal courier arrived at the governor's
with full intelligence of the calamity,
which did not differ in the least from the relation
which Swedenborg had given immediately
after the fire had ceased on the Saturday evening.</p>

<p>A circumstance has occurred while the writer
was engaged in the preparation of this paper,
which is of an equally curious character, to say
the least of it. The lady who is the subject of it
is a relation of the writer, and is no believer in
the "Mysteries of Mesmerism." It may be remarked,
however, that she is of a very sensitive
and excitable nervous temperament. It happened,
that on the night of the 30th of April, a
frightful accident occurred on the Birkenhead,
Lancashire, and Cheshire Railway, in consequence
of first one train, and then another, running
into the trains preceding. A frightful
scene of tumult, mutilation, and death ensued.
It happened that the husband of the lady in
question was a passenger in the first train;
though she did not know that he intended to go
to the Chester races, having been in Liverpool
that day on other business. But she had scarcely
fallen asleep, ere, half-dozing, half-awake, she
<i>saw</i> the accident occur&mdash;the terror, the alarm,
and the death. She walked up and down her
chamber in terror and alarm the whole night,
and imparted her fears to others in the morning.
Her husband was not injured, though greatly
shaken by the collision, and much alarmed; and
when he returned home in the course of the following
day, he could scarcely believe his wife
when she informed him of the circumstances
which had been so mysteriously revealed to her
in connection with his journey of the preceding
day!</p>

<p>Zschokke, an estimable man, well known as a
philosopher, statesman, and author, possessed,
according to his own and contemporary accounts,
the most extraordinary power of divination of the
characters and lives of other men with whom he
came in contact. He called it his "inward
sight," and at first he was himself quite as much
astonished at it as others were. Writing of this
feature himself, he says: "It has happened to
me, sometimes, on my first meeting with strangers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
as I listened silently to their discourse, that
their former life, with many trifling circumstances
therewith connected, or frequently some particular
scene in that life, has passed quite involuntarily,
and, as it were, dream-like, yet perfectly
distinct, before me. During this time, I usually
feel so entirely absorbed in the contemplation of
the stranger life, that at last I no longer see
clearly the face of the unknown, wherein I undesignedly
read, nor distinctly hear the voices of
the speakers, which before served in some measure
as a commentary to the text of their features.
For a long time I held such visions as delusions
of the fancy, and the more so as they showed me
even the dress and motions of the actors, rooms,
furniture, and other accessories. By way of
jest, I once, in a family circle at Kirchberg, related
the secret history of a seamstress who had
just left the room and the house. I had never
seen her before in my life; people were astonished
and laughed, but were not to be persuaded
that I did not previously know the relations of
which I spoke, for what I had uttered was the
<i>literal</i> truth; I, on my part, was no less astonished
that my dream-pictures were confirmed by
the reality. I became more attentive to the subject,
and when propriety admitted it, I would relate
to those whose life thus passed before me,
the subject of my vision, that I might thereby obtain
confirmation or refutation of it. It was invariably
ratified, not without consideration on
their part. I myself had less confidence than
any one in this mental jugglery. So often as I
revealed my visionary gifts to any new person, I
regularly expected to hear the answer: 'It was
not so.' I felt a secret shudder when my auditors
replied that it was <i>true</i>, or when their astonishment
betrayed my accuracy before they
spoke."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Zschokke gives numerous instances
of this extraordinary power of divination or waking
clairvoyance, and mentions other persons
whom he met, who possessed the same marvelous
power.</p>

<p>The "Posthumous Memoirs of La Harpe" contain
equally extraordinary revelations, looking <i>forward</i>,
instead of backward, as in Zschokke's case,
into the frightful events of the great French Revolution,
the sightseer being Cazove, a well-known
novel writer, who lived previous to the frightful
outbreak. Mary Howitt, in her account of the
extraordinary "Preaching Epidemic of Sweden,"
recites circumstances of the same kind, equally
wonderful; and the Rev. Mr. Sandy and Mr.
Townshend's books on mesmerism are full of
similar marvels. Among the various statements,
the grand point is, how much of them is true?
What are the <i>facts</i> of mesmerism? To quote
the great Bacon: "He who hath not first, and
before all, intimately explained the movements
of the human mind, and therein most accurately
distinguished the course of knowledge and the
seats of error, shall find all things masked, and,
as it were, enchanted; and, until he undo the
charm, shall be unable to interpret." How few
of us have yet arrived at this enviable position.</p>

<h2>CLARA CORSINI.&mdash;A TALE OF NAPLES.</h2>


<p>A young French traveler, named Ernest Leroy,
on arriving at Naples, found himself during
the first few days quite confused by the multitude
of his impressions. Now as it was in
search of impressions that he had left his beloved
Paris, there was nothing, it should seem,
very grievous in this; and yet in the midst of his
excitement there occurred intervals of intolerable
weariness of spirit&mdash;moments when he looked
upon the Strada Toledo with disgust, wished
himself any where but in San Carlos, sneered at
Posilippo, pooh-poohed Vesuvius, and was generally
skeptical as to the superiority of <i>the Bay</i>
over the Bosphorus, which he had not seen. All
this came to pass because he had set out on the
principle of traveling in a hurry, or, as he expressed
it, making the most of his time. Every
night before going to bed he made out and wrote
down a programme of next day's duties&mdash;assigning
so many hours to each sight, and so many
minutes to each meal, but forgetting altogether
to allow himself any opportunity for repose or
digestion.</p>

<p>Thus he had come from Paris <i>vi&acirc;</i> Milan, Florence,
and Rome, to Naples&mdash;the whole in the
space of three weeks, during which, as will be
easily imagined, he had visited an incredible number
of churches, galleries, temples, and ruins of
every description. In order to profit as much as
possible by his travels he had arranged beforehand
five or six series of ideas, or meditations as
he called them: one on the assistance afforded
by the fine arts to the progress of civilization,
another consisting of a string of sublime commonplaces
on the fall of empires and the moral value
of monumental history; and so on. Each of
these meditations he endeavored to recall on appropriate
occasions; and he never had leisure to
reflect, that for any instruction he was deriving
from what he saw he might as well have stopped
at home. However, having some imagination
and talent, he frequently found himself carried
away by thoughts born of the occasion, and so
irresistibly, that once or twice he went through a
whole gallery or church before he had done with
the train of ideas suggested by some previous
sight, and was only made aware that he had seen
some unique painting or celebrated windows of
stained-glass by the guide claiming payment for
his trouble, and asking him to sign a testimonial
doing justice to his civility and great store of valuable
information. It is only just to state that
M. Ernest never failed to comply with either of
these demands.</p>

<p>When, however, as we have said, he had been
two or three days in Naples, and had rushed over
the ground generally traversed by tourists, our
young traveler began to feel weary and disgusted.
For some time he did not understand what was
the matter, and upbraided himself with the lack
of industry and decline of enthusiasm, which
made him look forward with horror to the summons
of Giacomo, his guide, to be up and doing.
At length, however, during one sleepless night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the truth flashed upon him, and in the morning,
to his own surprise and delight, he mustered up
courage to dismiss Giacomo with a handsome
present, and to declare that that day at least he
was resolved to see nothing.</p>

<p>What a delightful stroll he took along the seashore
that morning with his eyes half-closed lest
he might be tempted to look around for information!
He went toward Portici, but he saw nothing
except the sand and pebbles at his feet, and
the white-headed surf that broke near at hand.
For the first time since his departure from Paris
he felt light-minded and at ease; and the only
incident that occurred to disturb his equanimity
was, when his eyes rested for half a second on
a broken pillar in a vine-garden, and he was
obliged to make an effort to pass by without ascertaining
whether it was of Roman date. But
this feat once accomplished, he threw up his cap
for joy, shouted "<i>Victoire!</i>" and really felt independent.</p>

<p>He was much mistaken, however, if he supposed
it to be possible to remain long in the enjoyment
of that <i>dolce far niente</i>, the first savor of
which so captivated him. One day, two days
passed, at the end of which he found that while
he had supposed himself to be doing nothing, he
had in reality made the great and only discovery
of his travels&mdash;namely, that the new country in
which he found himself was inhabited, and that,
too, by people who, though not quite so different
from his countrymen as the savages of the South
Sea Islands, possessed yet a very marked character
of their own, worthy of study and observation.
Thenceforward his journal began to be
filled with notes on costume, manners, &amp;c.; and
in three weeks, with wonderful modesty, after
combining the results of all his researches, he
came to the conclusion that he understood nothing
at all of the character of the Italians.</p>

<p>In this humble state of mind he wandered
forth one morning in the direction of the Castle
of St. Elmo, to enjoy the cool breeze that came
wafting from the sea, and mingled with and tempered
the early sunbeams as they streamed over
the eastern hills. Having reached a broad, silent
street, bordered only by a few houses and gardens,
he resolved not to extend his walk further,
but sat down on an old wooden bench under the
shade of a platane-tree that drooped over a lofty
wall. Here he remained some time watching
the few passengers that occasionally turned a
distant corner and advanced toward him. He
noticed that they all stopped at some one of the
houses further down the street, and that none
reached as far as where he sat; which led him
first to observe that beyond his position were only
two large houses, both apparently uninhabited.
One, indeed, was quite ruined&mdash;many of the windows
were built up or covered with old boards;
but the other showed fewer symptoms of decay,
and might be imagined to belong to some family
at that time absent in the country.</p>

<p>He had just come to this very important conclusion
when his attention was diverted by the
near approach of two ladies elegantly dressed,
followed by an elderly serving-man in plain livery,
carrying a couple of mass-books. They passed
him rather hurriedly, but not before he had time
to set them down as mother and daughter, and to
be struck with the great beauty and grace of the
latter. Indeed, so susceptible in that idle mood
was he of new impressions, that before the young
lady had gone on more than twenty paces he determined
that he was in love with her, and by an
instinctive impulse rose to follow. At this moment
the serving-man turned round, and threw
a calm but inquisitive glance toward him. He
checked himself, and affected to look the other
way for a while, then prepared to carry out his
original intention. To his great surprise, however,
both ladies and follower had disappeared.</p>

<p>An ordinary man would have guessed at once
that they had gone into one of the houses previously
supposed to be uninhabited, but M. Ernest
Leroy must needs fancy, first, that he had seen a
vision, and then that the objects of his interest
had been snatched away by some evil spirit. Mechanically,
however, he hurried to the end of the
street, which he found terminated in an open
piece of ground, which there had not been time
for any one to traverse. At length the rational
explanation of the matter occurred to him, and
he felt for a moment inclined to knock at the door
of the house that was in best preservation, and
complain of what he persisted in considering a
mysterious disappearance. However, not being
quite mad, he checked himself, and returning to
his wooden bench, sat down, and endeavored to
be very miserable.</p>

<p>But this would have been out of character.
Instead thereof he began to feel a new interest
in life, and to look back with some contempt on
the two previous phases of his travels. With
youthful romance and French confidence he resolved
to follow up this adventure, never doubting
for a moment of the possibility of ultimate
success, nor of the excellence of the object of his
hopes. What means to adopt did not, it is true,
immediately suggest themselves; and he remained
sitting for more than an hour gazing at
the great silent house opposite, until the unpleasant
consciousness that he had not breakfasted
forced him to beat a retreat.</p>

<p>We have not space to develop&mdash;luckily it is
not necessary&mdash;all the wild imaginings that fluttered
through the brain of our susceptible traveler
on his return to his lodgings, and especially after
a nourishing breakfast had imparted to him new
strength and vivacity. Under their influence he repaired
again to his post on the old wooden bench
under the platane-tree, and even had the perseverance
to make a third visit in the evening; for&mdash;probably,
because he expected the adventure to
draw out to a considerable length&mdash;he did not
imitate the foolish fantasy of some lovers, and
deprive himself of his regular meals. He saw
nothing that day; but next morning he had the
inexpressible satisfaction of again beholding the
two ladies approach, followed by their respectable-looking
servant. They passed without casting
a glance toward him; but their attendant this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
time not only turned round, but stopped, and
gazed at him in a manner he would have thought
impertinent on another occasion. For the moment,
however, this was precisely what he wanted,
and without thinking much of the consequences
that might ensue, he hastily made a sign
requesting an interview. The man only stared
the more, and then turning on his heel, gravely
followed the two ladies, who had just arrived at
the gateway of their house.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to make of that rascally
valet," thought Ernest. "He seems at once
respectable and hypocritical. Probably my appearance
does not strike him as representing
sufficient wealth, otherwise the hopes of a fair
bribe would have induced him at any rate to
come out and ask me what I meant."</p>

<p>He was, of course, once more at his post in
the afternoon; and this time he had the satisfaction
of seeing the door open, and the elderly
serving-man saunter slowly out, as if disposed to
enjoy the air. First he stopped on the steps,
cracking pistachio-nuts, and jerking the shells
into the road with his thumb; then took two or
three steps gently toward the other end of the
street; and at last, just as Ernest was about
to follow him, veered round and began to stroll
quietly across the road, still cracking his nuts,
in the direction of the old wooden bench.</p>

<p>"The villain has at length made up his mind,"
soliloquized our lover. "He pretends to come
out quite by accident, and will express great surprise
when I accost him in the way I intend."</p>

<p>The elderly serving-man still came on, seemingly
not at all in a hurry to arrive, and gave ample
time for an examination of his person. His
face was handsome, though lined by age and
care, and was adorned by a short grizzled beard.
There was something very remarkable in the
keenness of his large gray eyes, as there was
indeed about his whole demeanor. His dress was
a plain suit of black, that might have suited a
gentleman; and if Ernest had been less occupied
with one idea he would not have failed to see in
this respectable domestic a prince reduced by
misfortune to live on wages, or a hero who had
never had an opportunity of exhibiting his worth.</p>

<p>When this interesting person had reached the
corner of the bench he set himself down with a
slight nod of apology or recognition&mdash;it was difficult
to say which&mdash;and went on eating his nuts
quite unconcernedly. As often happens in such
cases, Ernest felt rather puzzled how to enter upon
business, and was trying to muster up an appearance
of condescending familiarity&mdash;suitable,
he thought, to the occasion&mdash;when the old man,
very affably holding out his paper-bag that he
might take some nuts, saved him the trouble by
observing: "You are a stranger, sir, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my good fellow," was the reply of Ernest,
in academical Italian; "and I have come
to this county&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought so," interrupted the serving-man,
persisting in his offer of nuts, but showing very
little interest about Ernest's views in visiting
Italy&mdash;"by your behavior."</p>

<p>"My behavior!" exclaimed the young man, a
little nettled.</p>

<p>"Precisely. But your quality of stranger has
hitherto protected you from any disagreeable consequences."</p>

<p>This was said so quietly, so amiably, that the
warning or menace wrapped up in the words lost
much of its bitter savor; yet our traveler could
not refrain from a haughty glance toward this
audacious domestic, on whom, however, it was
lost, for he was deeply intent on his pistachios.
After a moment Ernest recovered his self-possession,
remembered his schemes, and drawing a
little nearer the serving-man, laid his hand confidentially
on the sleeve of his coat, and said:
"My good man, I have a word or two for your
private ear."</p>

<p>Not expressing the least surprise or interest,
the other replied: "I am ready to hear what you
have to say, provided you will not call me any
more your good man. I am not a good man, nor
am I your man, without offense be it spoken.
My name is Alfonso."</p>

<p>"Well, Alfonso, you are an original person,
and I will not call you a good man, though honesty
and candor be written on your countenance.
(Alfonso smiled, but said nothing). But listen
to me attentively, remembering that though neither
am I a good man, yet am I a generous one.
I passionately love your mistress."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Alfonso, with any thing but a
benevolent expression of countenance. Ernest,
who was no physiognomist, noticed nothing;
and being mounted on his new hobby-horse, proceeded
at once to give a history of his impressions
since the previous morning. When he had
concluded, the old man, who seemed all benevolence
again, simply observed: "Then it is the
younger of the two ladies that captivated your
affections in this unaccountable manner!"</p>

<p>"Of course," cried Ernest; "and I beseech
you, my amiable Alfonso, to put me in the way
of declaring what I experience."</p>

<p>"You are an extraordinary young man," was
the grave reply; "an extraordinary, an imprudent,
and, I will add, a reckless person. You fall
in love with a person of whom you know nothing&mdash;not
even the name. This, however, is, I believe,
according to rule among a certain class of
minds. Not satisfied with this, you can find no
better way of introducing yourself to her notice
than endeavoring to corrupt one whom you must
have divined to be a confidential servant. Others
would have sought an introduction to the
family; you dream at once of a clandestine intercourse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I assure you&mdash;" interrupted Ernest, feeling
both ashamed and indignant at these remarks
proceeding from one so inferior in station.</p>

<p>"Assure me nothing, sir, as to your intentions,
for you do not know them yourself. I understand
you perfectly, because I was once young
and thoughtless like you. Now listen to me: in
that house dwells the Contessa Corsini, with her
daughter Clara; and if these two persons had no
one to protect them but themselves and a foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
old servitor, whom the first comer judges capable
of corruption, they would ere this have been
much molested; but it happens that the Count
Corsini is not dead, and inhabiteth with them,
although seldom coming forth into the public
streets. What say you, young man, does not
this a little disturb your plans?"</p>

<p>"In the first place," replied Ernest, "I am offended
that you will persist in implying&mdash;more,
it is true, by your manner than your words&mdash;that
my views are not perfectly avowable."</p>

<p>"Then why, in the name of Heaven, do you
not make yourself known to the count, stating
your object, and asking formally for his daughter's
hand?"</p>

<p>"Not so fast, Alfonso. It was necessary for
me to learn, as a beginning, that there was a
count in the case."</p>

<p>"And what do you know now? Perhaps those
women are two adventurers, and I a rascal playing
a virtuous part, in order the better to deceive
you."</p>

<p>"You do not look like a rascal," said Ernest,
quite innocently. At which observation the old
man condescended to laugh heartily, and seemed
from that moment to take quite a liking to his
new acquaintance. After a little while, indeed,
he began to give some information about the
young Clara, who, he said, was only sixteen
years of age, though quite a woman in appearance,
and not unaccomplished. As to her dowry&mdash;Ernest
interrupted him by saying, that he
wished for no information on that point, being
himself rich. The old man smiled amiably, and
ended the conversation by requesting another interview
next day at the same hour, by which time,
he said, he might have some news to tell.</p>

<p>Ernest returned home in high spirits, which
sank by degrees, however, when he reflected that
as Alfonso declined favoring any clandestine correspondence,
there was little in reality to be expected
from him. True, he had given him some
information, and he might now, by means of his
letters of introduction, contrive to make acquaintance
with the count. But though he spent the
whole evening and next morning in making inquiries,
he could not meet with any one who had
ever even heard of such a person. "Possibly,"
he thought, "the old sinner may have been laughing
at me all the time, and entered into conversation
simply with the object of getting up a story
to divert the other domestics of the house. If
such be the case, he may be sure I shall wreak
vengeance upon him."</p>

<p>In spite of these reflections, he was at his post
at the hour appointed, and felt quite overjoyed
when Alfonso made his appearance. The old
man said that a plan had suggested itself by
which he might be introduced into the house&mdash;namely,
that he should pretend to be a professor
of drawing, and offer his services. Ernest did
not inquire how Alfonso came to know that he
was an amateur artist, but eagerly complied with
the plan, and was instructed to call on the following
morning, and to say that he had heard that a
drawing-master was wanted.</p>

<p>He went accordingly, not very boldly, it is true,
and looking very much in reality like a poor professor
anxious to obtain employment. The contessa,
who was yet young and beautiful, received
him politely, listened to his proposals, and made
no difficulty in accepting them. The preliminaries
arranged, Clara was called, and, to Ernest's
astonishment, came bouncing into the room like
a great school-girl, looked him very hard in the
face, and among the first things she said, asked
him if he was not the man she had seen two
mornings following sitting opposite the house on
the bench under the platane tree.</p>

<p>Now Ernest had imagined to himself something
so refined, so delicate, so fairy-like, instead
of this plain reality, that he all at once began to
feel disgusted, and to wish he had acted more
prudently. And yet there was Clara, exactly as
he had seen her, except that she had exchanged
the demure, conventional step adopted by ladies
in the street for the free motions of youth; and
except that, instead of casting her eyes to the
earth, or glancing at him sideways, she now looked
toward him with a frank and free gaze, and
spoke what came uppermost in her mind. Certes,
most men would have chosen that moment to fall
in love with so charming a creature; for charming
she was beyond all doubt, with large, rich,
black eyes, pouting ruby lips, fine oval cheeks,
and a mass of ebony hair; but Ernest's first impression
was disappointment, and he began to
criticise both her and every thing by which she
was surrounded.</p>

<p>He saw at once that there was poverty in the
house. The furniture was neat, but scanty; and
the door had been opened by a female servant,
who had evidently been disturbed from some domestic
avocations. The contessa and her daughter
were dressed very plainly&mdash;far differently from
what they had been in the street; and it was an
easy matter to see that this plainness was not
adopted from choice but from necessity. Had
Clara come into the room with a slow, creeping
step, keeping her eyes modestly fixed on the
chipped marble floor, not one of these observations
would have been made: the large, dreary
house would have been a palace in Ernest's eyes;
but his taste was a morbid one, and in five minutes
after he had begun to give his lesson, he
began to fear that the conquest he had so ardently
desired would be only too easy.</p>

<p>There was something, however, so cheerful
and fascinating in Clara's manner that he could
not but soon learn to feel pleasure in her society:
and when he went away he determined, instead
of starting off for Sicily, as he had at first thought
of doing, to pay at least one more visit to the
house in the character of drawing master. Alfonso
joined him as he walked slowly homeward,
and asked him how things had passed. He related
frankly his first impressions, to which the
old man listened very attentively without making
any remark. At parting, however, he shook his
head, saying that young men were of all animals
the most difficult to content.</p>

<p>Next day, when Ernest went to give his lesson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
he was told by Alfonso that the contessa,
being indisposed, had remained in bed, but that
he should find Clara in the garden. There was
something romantic in the sound of this, so he
hurried to the spot indicated, impatient to have
the commonplace impressions of the previous day
effaced. This time his disgust was complete.
He found Clara engaged in assisting the servant
maid to wring and hang out some clothes they
had just finished washing. She seemed not at
all put out by being caught thus humbly employed;
but begging him to wait a little, finished
her work, ran away, dressed somewhat carefully,
and returning begged he would return to the
house. He followed with cheeks burning with
shame: he felt the utmost contempt for himself
because he had fallen in love with this little housewife,
and the greatest indignation against her for
having presumed, very innocently, to excite so
poetical a sentiment; and, in the stupidity of his
offended self-love, resolved to avenge himself by
making some spiteful remark ere he escaped from
a house into which he considered that he had been
regularly entrapped. Accordingly, when she took
the pencil in hand, he observed that probably she
imagined that contact with soap-suds would improve
the delicacy of her touch. Clara did not reply,
but began to sketch in a manner that proved
she had listened to the pedantic rules he had laid
down on occasion of the previous lesson more
from modesty than because she was in want of
them. Then suddenly rising without attending
to some cavil he thought it his duty to make, she
went to the piano, and beginning to play, drew
forth such ravishing notes, that Ernest, who was
himself no contemptible musician, could not refrain
from applauding enthusiastically. She received
his compliments with a slight shrug of the
shoulders, and commenced a song that enabled
her to display with full effect the capabilities of
her magnificent voice. The soap-suds were forgotten;
and Ernest's romance was coming back
upon him: he began to chide himself for his foolish
prejudices; and thought that, after all, with
a little training, Clara might be made quite a
lady. Suddenly, however, she broke off her song,
and turning toward him with an ironical smile,
said: "Not bad for a housemaid, Mr. Professor&mdash;is
it?"</p>

<p>He attempted to excuse himself, but he was
evidently judged; and, what was more&mdash;not as
an obscure drawing-master, but as M. Ernest
Leroy. His identity was evidently no secret;
and she even called him by his name. He endeavored
in vain to make a fine speech to apologize
for his ill-behavior; but she interrupted him
keenly, though good-humoredly, and the entrance
of Alfonso was fatal to a fine scene of despair he
was about to enact. Clara upon this retired with
a profound salute; and Alfonso spoke with more
of dignity than usual in his manner, and said:
"My young friend, you must excuse a little deception
which has been practiced on you, or rather
which you have practiced upon yourself. I am
going to be very free and frank with you to-day.
I am not what you take me for. I am the Count
Corsini, a Roman; and because I have not the
means of keeping a man-servant, when the women
of my family go to church I follow them, as you
saw. This is not unusual among my countrymen.
It is a foolish pride I know; but so it is.
However, the matter interests you not. You saw
my daughter Clara, and thought you loved her.
I was willing, as on inquiry I found you to be a
respectable person, to see how you could agree
together; but your pride&mdash;I managed and overheard
all&mdash;has destroyed your chance. My daughter
will seek another husband."</p>

<p>There was a cold friendliness in Alfonso's tone
which roused the pride of Ernest. He affected
to laugh, called himself a foolish madcap, but
hinted that a splendid marriage awaited him, if
he chose, on his return to Paris; and went away
endeavoring to look unconcerned. The following
morning he was on board a vessel bound for
Palermo, very sea-sick it is true, but thinking at
the same time a great deal more of Clara than he
could have thought possible had it been predicted.</p>

<p>Some few years afterward Ernest Leroy was
in one of the <i>salons</i> of the Fauxbourg St. Germain.
Still a bachelor, he no longer felt those sudden
emotions to which he had been subject in his earlier
youth. He was beginning to talk less of sentiments
present and more of sentiments passed.
In confidential moods he would lay his hand upon
his waistcoat&mdash;curved out at its lower extremity,
by the by, by a notable increase of substance&mdash;and
allude to a certain divine Clara who had
illuminated a moment of his existence. But he
was too discreet to enter into details.</p>

<p>Well, being in that <i>salon</i>, as we have said,
pretending to amuse himself, his attention was
suddenly drawn by the announcement of Lady
D&mdash;&mdash;. He turned round, probably to quiz <i>la
belle Anglaise</i> he expected to behold. What was
his astonishment on recognizing in the superb
woman who leaned on the arm of a tall, military-looking
Englishman, the identical Clara Corsini
of his youthful memories. He felt at first sick
at heart; but, taking courage, soon went up and
spoke to her. She remembered him with some
little difficulty, smiled, and holding out her alabaster
hand, said gently: "Do you see any trace
of the soap-suds?" She never imagined he had
any feeling in him, and only knew the truth when
a large, round tear fell on the diamond of her
ring. "Charles," said Ernest awhile afterward
to a friend, "it is stifling hot and dreadfully
stupid here. Let us go and have a game of
billiards."</p>

<h3>BY CHARLES DICKENS.</h3>


<p>We went to look at it, only this last Midsummer,
and found that the Railway had cut it
up root and branch. A great trunk-line had swallowed
the play-ground, sliced away the school-room,
and pared off the corner of the house:
which, thus curtailed of its proportions, presented
itself, in a green stage of stucco, profile-wise toward
the road, like a forlorn flat-iron without a
handle, standing on end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems as if our schools were doomed to be
the sport of change. We have faint recollections
of a Preparatory Day-School, which we have
sought in vain, and which must have been pulled
down to make a new street, ages ago. We have
dim impressions, scarcely amounting to a belief,
that it was over a dyer's shop. We know that
you went up steps to it; that you frequently
grazed your knees in doing so; that you generally
got your leg over the scraper, in trying to
scrape the mud off a very unsteady little shoe.
The mistress of the Establishment holds no place
in our memory; but, rampant on one eternal
door-mat, in an eternal entry, long and narrow,
is a puffy pug-dog, with a personal animosity
toward us, who triumphs over Time. The bark
of that baleful Pug, a certain radiating way he
had of snapping at our undefended legs, the
ghastly grinning of his moist black muzzle and
white teeth, and the insolence of his crisp tail
curled like a pastoral crook, all live and flourish.
From an otherwise unaccountable association of
him with a fiddle, we conclude that he was of
French extraction, and his name <i>Fid&egrave;le</i>. He belonged
to some female, chiefly inhabiting a back-parlor,
whose life appears to us to have been
consumed in sniffing, and in wearing a brown
beaver bonnet. For her, he would sit up and
balance cake upon his nose, and not eat it until
twenty had been counted. To the best of our
belief, we were once called in to witness this
performance; when, unable, even in his milder
moments, to endure our presence, he instantly
made at us, cake and all.</p>

<p>Why a something in mourning, called "Miss
Frost," should still connect itself with our preparatory
school, we are unable to say. We retain
no impression of the beauty of Miss Frost&mdash;if
she were beautiful; or of the mental fascinations
of Miss Frost&mdash;if she were accomplished; yet her
name and her black dress hold an enduring place
in our remembrance. An equally impersonal boy,
whose name has long since shaped itself unalterably
into "Master Mawls," is not to be dislodged
from our brain. Retaining no vindictive feeling
toward Mawls&mdash;no feeling whatever, indeed&mdash;we
infer that neither he nor we can have loved Miss
Frost. Our first impression of Death and Burial
is associated with this formless pair. We all three
nestled awfully in a corner one wintry day, when
the wind was blowing shrill, with Miss Frost's
pinafore over our heads; and Miss Frost told us
in a whisper about somebody being "screwed
down." It is the only distinct recollection we
preserve of these impalpable creatures, except a
suspicion that the manners of Master Mawls were
susceptible of much improvement. Generally
speaking, we may observe that whenever we see
a child intently occupied with its nose, to the exclusion
of all other subjects of interest, our mind
reverts in a flash to Master Mawls.</p>

<p>But, the School that was Our School before the
Railroad came and overthrew it, was quite another
sort of place. We were old enough to be
put into Virgil when we went there, and to get
Prizes for a variety of polishing on which the rust
has long accumulated. It was a School of some
celebrity in its neighborhood&mdash;nobody could have
said why&mdash;and we had the honor to attain and
hold the eminent position of first boy. The master
was supposed among us to know nothing, and
one of the ushers was supposed to know every
thing. We are still inclined to think the first-named
supposition perfectly correct.</p>

<p>We have a general idea that its subject had
been in the leather trade, and had bought us&mdash;meaning
our School&mdash;of another proprietor, who
was immensely learned. Whether this belief
had any real foundation, we are not likely ever
to know now. The only branches of education
with which he showed the least acquaintance,
were, ruling, and corporally punishing. He was
always ruling ciphering-books with a bloated
mahogany ruler, or smiting the palms of offenders
with the same diabolical instrument, or viciously
drawing a pair of pantaloons tight with one of
his large hands, and caning the wearer with the
other. We have no doubt whatever that this
occupation was the principal solace of his existence.</p>

<p>A profound respect for money pervaded Our
School, which was, of course, derived from its
Chief. We remember an idiotic, goggle-eyed
boy, with a big head and half-crowns without
end, who suddenly appeared as a parlor-boarder,
and was rumored to have come by sea from some
mysterious part of the earth where his parents
rolled in gold. He was usually called "Mr." by
the Chief, and was said to feed in the parlor on
steaks and gravy; likewise to drink currant
wine. And he openly stated that if rolls and
coffee were ever denied him at breakfast, he
would write home to that unknown part of the
globe from which he had come, and cause himself
to be recalled to the regions of gold. He
was put into no form or class, but learnt alone,
as little as he liked&mdash;and he liked very little&mdash;and
there was a belief among us that this was
because he was too wealthy to be "taken down."
His special treatment, and our vague association
of him with the sea, and with storms, and sharks,
and coral reefs, occasioned the wildest legends
to be circulated as his history. A tragedy in
blank verse was written on the subject&mdash;if our
memory does not deceive us, by the hand that
now chronicles these recollections&mdash;in which his
father figured as a Pirate, and was shot for a
voluminous catalogue of atrocities: first imparting
to his wife the secret of the cave in which
his wealth was stored, and from which his only
son's half-crowns now issued. Dumbledon (the
boy's name) was represented as "yet unborn,"
when his brave father met his fate; and the despair
and grief of Mrs. Dumbledon at that calamity
was movingly shadowed forth as having
weakened the parlor-boarder's mind. This production
was received with great favor, and was
twice performed with closed doors in the dining-room.
But, it got wind, and was seized as libelous,
and brought the unlucky poet into severe
affliction. Some two years afterward, all of a
sudden one day, Dumbledon vanished. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
whispered that the Chief himself had taken him
down to the Docks, and reshipped him for the
Spanish Main; but nothing certain was ever
known about his disappearance. At this hour,
we can not thoroughly disconnect him from California.</p>

<p>Our School was rather famous for mysterious
pupils. There was another&mdash;a heavy young
man, with a large double-cased silver watch, and
a fat knife, the handle of which was a perfect
tool-box&mdash;who unaccountably appeared one day
at a special desk of his own, erected close to that
of the Chief, with whom he held familiar converse.
He lived in the parlor, and went out for
walks, and never took the least notice of us&mdash;even
of us, the first boy&mdash;unless to give us a depreciatory
kick, or grimly to take our hat off and
throw it away, when he encountered us out of
doors: which unpleasant ceremony he always
performed as he passed&mdash;not even condescending
to stop for the purpose. Some of us believed
that the classical attainments of this phenomenon
were terrific, but that his penmanship and arithmetic
were defective, and he had come there to
mend them; others, that he was going to set up
a school, and had paid the Chief "twenty-five
pound down," for leave to see Our School at
work. The gloomier spirits even said that he
was going to buy <i>us</i>; against which contingency
conspiracies were set on foot for a general
defection and running away. However, he never
did that. After staying for a quarter, during
which period, though closely observed, he was
never seen to do any thing but make pens out of
quills, write small-hand in a secret portfolio, and
punch the point of the sharpest blade in his knife
into his desk, all over it, he, too, disappeared, and
his place knew him no more.</p>

<p>There was another boy, a fair, meek boy, with
a delicate complexion and rich curling hair, who,
we found out, or thought we found out (we have
no idea now, and probably had none then, on
what grounds, but it was confidentially revealed
from mouth to mouth), was the son of a Viscount
who had deserted his lovely mother. It was understood
that if he had his rights, he would be
worth twenty thousand a year. And that if his
mother ever met his father, she would shoot him
with a silver pistol which she carried, always
loaded to the muzzle, for that purpose. He was
a very suggestive topic. So was a young Mulatto,
who was always believed (though very amiable)
to have a dagger about him somewhere.
But, we think they were both outshone, upon
the whole, by another boy who claimed to have
been born on the twenty-ninth of February, and
to have only one birthday in five years. We
suspect this to have been a fiction&mdash;but he lived
upon it all the time he was at Our School.</p>

<p>The principal currency of Our School was
slate-pencil. It had some inexplicable value,
that was never ascertained, never reduced to a
standard. To have a great hoard of it, was somehow
to be rich. We used to bestow it in charity,
and confer it as a precious boon upon our chosen
friends. When the holidays were coming, contributions
were solicited for certain boys whose
relatives were in India, and who were appealed
for under the generic name of "Holiday-stoppers"&mdash;appropriate
marks of remembrance that
should enliven and cheer them in their homeless
state. Personally, we always contributed these
tokens of sympathy in the form of slate-pencil,
and always felt that it would be a comfort and a
treasure to them.</p>

<p>Our School was remarkable for white mice.
Red-polls, linnets, and even canaries, were kept
in desks, drawers, hat-boxes, and other strange
refuges for birds; but white mice were the favorite
stock. The boys trained the mice, much
better than the masters trained the boys. We
recall one white mouse, who lived in the cover
of a Latin dictionary, who ran up ladders, drew
Roman chariots, shouldered muskets, turned
wheels, and even made a very creditable appearance
on the stage as the Dog of Montargis. He
might have achieved greater things, but for having
the misfortune to mistake his way in a triumphal
procession to the Capitol, when he fell
into a deep inkstand, and was dyed black, and
drowned. The mice were the occasion of some
most ingenious engineering, in the construction
of their houses and instruments of performance.
The famous one belonged to a Company of proprietors,
some of whom have since made Railroads,
Engines, and Telegraphs; the chairman
has erected mills and bridges in New Zealand.</p>

<p>The usher at our school, who was considered
to know every thing as opposed to the Chief who
was considered to know nothing, was a bony,
gentle-faced, clerical-looking young man in rusty
black. It was whispered that he was sweet upon
one of Maxby's sisters (Maxby lived close by,
and was a day pupil), and further that he "favored
Maxby." As we remember, he taught
Italian to Maxby's sisters on half-holidays. He
once went to the play with them, and wore a
white waistcoat and a rose: which was considered
among us equivalent to a declaration. We
were of opinion on that occasion that to the last
moment he expected Maxby's father to ask him
to dinner at five o'clock, and therefore neglected
his own dinner at half-past one, and finally got
none. We exaggerated in our imaginations the
extent to which he punished Maxby's father's
cold meat at supper; and we agreed to believe
that he was elevated with wine and water when
he came home. But, we all liked him; for he
had a good knowledge of boys, and would have
made it a much better school if he had had more
power. He was writing-master, mathematical-master,
English master, made out the bills, mended
the pens, and did all sorts of things. He divided
the little boys with the Latin master (they
were smuggled through their rudimentary books,
at odd times when there was nothing else to do),
and he always called at parents' houses to inquire
after sick boys, because he had gentlemanly
manners. He was rather musical, and on
some remote quarter-day had bought an old trombone;
but a bit of it was lost, and it made the most
extraordinary sounds when he sometimes tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
to play it of an evening. His holidays never began
(on account of the bills) until long after ours;
but in the summer-vacations he used to take pedestrian
excursions with a knapsack; and at
Christmas-time he went to see his father at
Chipping Norton, who we all said (on no authority)
was a dairy-fed-pork-butcher. Poor fellow!
He was very low all day on Maxby's sister's
wedding-day, and afterward was thought to favor
Maxby more than ever, though he had been expected
to spite him. He has been dead these
twenty years. Poor fellow!</p>

<p>Our remembrance of Our School, presents the
Latin master as a colorless, doubled-up, near-sighted
man with a crutch, who was always
cold, and always putting onions into his ears
for deafness, and always disclosing ends of flannel
under all his garments, and almost always
applying a ball of pocket-handkerchief to some
part of his face with a screwing action round
and round. He was a very good scholar, and
took great pains where he saw intelligence and
a desire to learn; otherwise, perhaps not. Our
memory presents him (unless teased into a passion)
with as little energy as color&mdash;as having
been worried and tormented into monotonous
feebleness&mdash;as having had the best part of his
life ground out of him in a mill of boys. We
remember with terror how he fell asleep one
sultry afternoon with the little smuggled class
before him, and awoke not when the footstep
of the Chief fell heavy on the floor; how the
Chief aroused him, in the midst of a dread silence,
and said, "Mr. Blinkins, are you ill, sir?"
how he blushingly replied, "Sir, rather so;"
how the Chief retorted with severity, "Mr. Blinkins,
this is no place to be ill in" (which was
very, very true), and walked back, solemn as
the ghost in Hamlet, until, catching a wandering
eye, he caned that boy for inattention, and happily
expressed his feelings toward the Latin
master through the medium of a substitute.</p>

<p>There was a fat little dancing-master who
used to come in a gig, and taught the more advanced
among us hornpipes (as an accomplishment
in great social demand in after-life); and
there was a brisk little French master who used
to come in the sunniest weather with a handleless
umbrella, and to whom the Chief was always
polite, because (as we believed), if the
Chief offended him, he would instantly address
the Chief in French, and forever confound him
before the boys with his inability to understand
or reply.</p>

<p>There was, besides, a serving man, whose
name was Phil. Our retrospective glance presents
Phil as a shipwrecked carpenter, cast away
upon the desert island of a school, and carrying
into practice an ingenious inkling of many trades.
He mended whatever was broken, and made
whatever was wanted. He was general glazier,
among other things, and mended all the broken
windows&mdash;at the prime cost (as was darkly rumored
among us) of ninepence for every square
charged three-and-six to parents. We had a
high opinion of his mechanical genius, and generally
held that the Chief "knew something bad
of him," and on pain of divulgence enforced Phil
to be his bondsman. We particularly remember
that Phil had a sovereign contempt for learning;
which engenders in us a respect for his sagacity,
as it implies his accurate observation of the relative
positions of the Chief and the ushers. He
was an impenetrable man, who waited at table
between whiles, and, throughout "the half" kept
the boxes in severe custody. He was morose,
even to the Chief, and never smiled, except at
breaking-up, when, in acknowledgment of the
toast, "Success to Phil! Hooray!" he would
slowly carve a grin out of his wooden face, where
it would remain until we were all gone. Nevertheless,
one time when we had the scarlet fever
in the school, Phil nursed all the sick boys of his
own accord, and was like a mother to them.</p>

<p>There was another school not far off, and of
course our school could have nothing to say to
that school. It is mostly the way with schools,
whether of boys or men. Well! the railway has
swallowed up ours, and the locomotives now run
smoothly over its ashes.</p>

<span class="i0">All that this world is proud of,<br /></span>

<p>and is not proud of, too. It had little reason to
be proud of Our School, and has done much better
since in that way, and will do far better yet.</p>

<h2>A STORY OF ORIENTAL LOVE.</h2>


<p>Poets have complained in all countries and
in all ages, that true love ever meets with obstacles
and hindrances, and the highest efforts of
their art have been exhausted in commemorating
the sufferings or the triumphs of affection.
Will the theme ever cease to interest? Will the
hopes, the fears, the joys, the vows of lovers, ever
be deemed matters of light moment, unworthy to
be embalmed and preserved in those immortal
caskets which genius knows how to frame out
of words? If that dreary time be destined to
come&mdash;if victory decide in favor of those mechanical
philosophers who would drive sentiment out
of the world&mdash;sad will be the lot of mortals; for
it is better to die with a heart full of love, than
live for an age without feeling one vibration of
that divine passion.</p>

<p>I am almost ashamed to translate into this level
English, the sublime rhapsody with which the
worthy Sheikh Ibrahim introduced the simple story
about to be repeated. The truth is, I do not
remember much of what he said, and at times he
left me far behind, as he soared up through the
cloudy heaven of his enthusiasm. I could only
occasionally discern his meaning as it flashed
along; but a solemn, rapturous murmur of inarticulate
sounds swept over my soul, and prepared
it to receive with devout faith and respect, what
else might have appeared to me a silly tale of
truth and constancy and passionate devotion. I
forgot the thousand musquitoes that were whirling
with threatening buzz around; the bubbling
of the water-pipe grew gradually less frequent,
and at length died away; and the sides of the
kiosque overlooking the river, with its flitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
sails and palm-fringed shores dimming in the
twilight, seemed to open and throw back a long
vista into the past. I listened, and the Sheikh
continued to speak:</p>

<p>I will relate the story of Gadallah, the son of
the sword-maker, and of Hosneh, the daughter
of the merchant. It is handed down to us by
tradition, and the fathers of some yet living, remember
to have heard it told by eye-witnesses.
Not that any great weight of testimony is required
to exact belief. No extraordinary incident befell
the lovers; and the pure-hearted, when they hear
these things, will say within themselves, "This
must be so; we would have done likewise."</p>

<p>Gadallah was a youth of wonderful beauty;
his like is only to be seen once in a long summer's
day, by the favor of God. All Cairo spoke
of him, and mothers envied his mother, and fathers
his father; and maidens who beheld him
grew faint with admiration, and loved as hopelessly
as if he had been the brightest star of
heaven. For he did not incline to such thoughts,
and had been taught to despise women, and to
believe that they were all wicked and designing&mdash;full
of craft and falsehood. Such instructions
had his mother given him, for she knew the
snares that would beset so beautiful a youth,
and feared for him, lest he might be led into
danger and misfortune.</p>

<p>Gadallah worked with his father in the shop,
and being a cunning artificer, assisted to support
the family. He had many brothers and sisters,
all younger than he; but there were times when
money was scarce with them, and they were compelled
to borrow for their daily expenses of their
neighbors, and to trust to Providence for the
means of repayment. Thus time passed, and
they became neither richer nor poorer, as is the
common lot of men who labor for their bread;
but neither Gadallah nor his father repined.
When Allah gave good fortune they blessed him,
and when no good fortune was bestowed, they
blessed him for not taking away that which they
had. They who spend their lives in industry and
in praise of God, can not be unhappy.</p>

<p>It came to pass one day, that a man richly
dressed, riding on a mule, and followed by servants,
stopped opposite the shop, and calling to
the father of Gadallah, said to him: "O Sheikh,
I have a sword, the hilt of which is broken, and
I desire thee to come to my house and mend it;
for it is of much value, and there is a word of
power written on it, and I can not allow it to
leave the shelter of my roof." The sword-maker
answered: "O master, it will be better that
my son should accompany thee; for he is young,
and his eyes are sharp, and his hand is clever,
while I am growing old, and not fit for the finer
work." The customer replied that it was well,
and having given Gadallah time to take his tools,
rode slowly away, the youth following him at a
modest distance.</p>

<p>They proceeded to a distant quarter, where the
streets were silent and the houses large and lofty,
surrounded by gardens with tall trees that trembled
overhead in the sun-light. At length they
stopped before a mansion fit for a prince, and Gadallah
entered along with the owner. A spacious
court, with fountains playing in the shade of two
large sycamores, and surrounded by light colonnades,
so struck the young sword-maker with astonishment,
that he exclaimed: "Blessed be God,
whose creatures are permitted to rear palaces so
beautiful!" These words caused the master to
smile with benignity, for who is insensible to the
praise of his own house? And he said: "Young
man, thou seest only a portion of that which has
been bestowed upon me&mdash;extolled be the Lord
and his Prophet; follow me." So they passed
through halls of surprising magnificence, until
they came to a lofty door, over which swept long
crimson curtains, and which was guarded by a
black slave with a sword in his hand. He looked
at Gadallah with surprise when the master said
"open," but obeying, admitted them to a spacious
saloon&mdash;more splendid than any that had preceded.</p>

<p>Now Gadallah having never seen the interior
of any house better than that of his neighbor the
barber, who was a relation by the mother's side,
and highly respected as a man of wealth and condition,
was lost in amazement and wonder at all
he beheld, not knowing that he was the most
beautiful thing in that saloon, and scarcely ventured
to walk, lest he might stain the polished
marble or the costly carpets. His conductor, who
was evidently a good man, from the delight he
honestly showed at this artless tribute to his magnificence,
took him to a small cabinet containing
a chest inlaid with mother-of-pearl. This he
opened, and producing a sword, the like of which
never came from Damascus, bade him observe
where the hilt was broken, and ordered him to
mend it carefully. Then he left him, saying he
would return in an hour.</p>

<p>Gadallah began his work with the intention of
being very industrious; but he soon paused to
admire at leisure the splendor of the saloon;
when he had fed his eyes with this, he turned to
a window that looked upon a garden, and saw
that it was adorned with lovely trees, bright flowers,
elegant kiosques, and running fountains. An
aviary hard by was filled with singing-birds,
which warbled the praises of the Creator. His
mind soon became a wilderness of delight, in
which leaf-laden branches waved, and roses, and
anemones, and pinks, and fifty more of the bright
daughters of spring, blushed and glittered; and
melody wandered with hesitating steps, like a
spirit seeking the coolest and sweetest place of
rest. This was like an exquisite dream; but
presently, straying in a path nigh at hand, he
beheld an unvailed maiden and her attendant.
It was but for a moment she appeared, yet her
image was so brightly thrown in upon his heart,
that he loved her ever afterward with a love
as unchangeable as the purity of the heavens.
When she was gone, he sat himself down beside
the broken sword and wept.</p>

<p>The master of the house came back, and gently
chid him for his idleness. "Go," said he, "and
return to-morrow at the same hour. Thou hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
now sufficiently fed thine eyes&mdash;go; but remember,
envy me not the wealth which God hath
bestowed." Gadallah went his way, having first
ascertained from the servants, that his employer
was the Arabian merchant Zen-ed-din, whose
daughter Hosneh was said to surpass in beauty
all the maidens of the land of Egypt. On reaching
the house, he repaired to his mother's side,
and sitting down, told her of all he had seen and
all he felt, beseeching her to advise him and predict
good fortune to him.</p>

<p>Fatoumeh, the mother of Gadallah, was a wise
woman, and understood that his case was hopeless,
unless his desires received accomplishment.
But it seemed to her impossible that the son of
the poor sword-maker should ever be acceptable
to the daughter of the wealthy merchant. She
wept plentifully at the prospect of misery that
unfolded itself, and when her husband came in,
he also wept; and all three mingled their tears
together until a late hour of the night.</p>

<p>Next day Gadallah went at the appointed hour
to the merchant's house, and being kindly received,
finished the work set to him; but saw no
more of the maiden who had disturbed his mind.
Zen-ed-din paid him handsomely for his trouble,
and added some words of good advice. This done,
he gently dismissed him, promising he would recall
him shortly for other work; and the youth
returned home despairing of all future happiness.
The strength of his love was so great, that it
shook him like a mighty fever, and he remained
ill upon his couch that day, and the next, and
the next, until he approached the margin of the
grave; but his hour was not yet come, and he
recovered.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Angel of Death received
permission from the Almighty to smite thirty
thousand of the inhabitants of Cairo; and he
sent a great plague, that introduced sorrow into
every house. It flew rapidly from quarter to
quarter, and from street to street, smiting the
chosen of the tomb&mdash;the young, the old, the bad,
the good, the rich, the poor&mdash;here, there, every
where; in the palace, the hovel, the shop, the
market-place, the deewan. All day and all night
the shriek of sorrow resounded in the air; and
the thoroughfares were filled with people following
corpses to the cemetery. Many fled into other
cities and other lands; but the plague followed
those who were doomed, and struck them down
by the wayside, or in the midst of their new
friends.</p>

<p>It happened that the merchant Zen-ed-din had
gone upon a journey, and had left his house, and
his harem, and his lovely daughter, under the
care of Providence, so that when Gadallah recovered,
before the pestilence reached its height,
he waited in vain in the shop, expecting that the
merchant would pass, and invite him again to his
house. At length the affliction of the city reached
so great a degree of intensity, that all business
was put a stop to, the bazaars were deserted, and
men waited beneath their own roofs the inevitable
decrees of fate.</p>

<p>Gadallah, who had confidence in God, spent
part of his time walking in the streets; but every
day went and sat on a stone bench opposite to
Zen-ed-din's house, expecting to see some one
come forth who might tell him that all were well
within. But the doors remained closed, and not
a sound ever proceeded from the interior of the
vast mansion. At length, however, when he
came at the usual hour, he perceived that the
great entrance-gate was left half-open, and he
mustered up courage to enter. He found the
Bawab dead on his bench, and two black slaves
by the side of the fountain. His heart smote
him with a presentiment of evil. He advanced
into the inner halls without seeing a sign of life.
Behind the great crimson curtains that swept
over the doorway of the saloon where he had
worked, lay the guardian with his sword still in
his hand. He pressed forward, finding every
place deserted. Raising his voice at length, he
called aloud, and asked if any living thing remained
within those walls. No reply came but
the echo that sounded dismally along the roof;
with a heart oppressed by fear, he entered what
he knew to be the ladies' private apartments;
and here he found the attendant of Hosneh dying.
She looked amazed at beholding a stranger,
and, at first, refused to reply to his questions.
But, at length, in a faint voice, she said that the
plague had entered the house the day before like
a raging lion, that many fell victims almost instantly,
and that the women of the harem in a
state of wild alarm had fled. "And Hosneh?"
inquired Gadallah. "She is laid out in the
kiosque, in the garden," replied the girl, who
almost immediately afterward breathed her last.</p>

<p>Gadallah remained for some time gazing at her,
and still listening, as if to ascertain that he had
heard correctly. Then he made his way to the
garden, and searched the kiosques, without finding
what he sought, until he came to one raised
on a light terrace, amid a grove of waving trees.
Here beneath a canopy of white silk, on pillows
of white silk, and all clothed in white silk, lay
the form that had so long dwelt in his heart.
Without fear of the infection, having first asked
pardon of God, he stooped over her, and kissed
those lips that had never even spoken to a man
except her father; and he wished that death
might come to him likewise; and he ventured
to lie down by her side, that the two whom life
could never have brought together, might be
found united at least under one shroud.</p>

<p>A rustling close by attracted his attention. It
was a dove fluttering down to her accustomed
place on a bough, which once gained, she rolled
forth from her swelling throat a cooing challenge
to her partner in a distant tree. On reverting his
look to the face of Hosneh, Gadallah thought he
saw a faint red tint upon the lips he had pressed,
like the first blush of the dawn in a cold sky. He
gazed with wonder and delight, and became convinced
he was not mistaken. He ran to a fountain
and brought water in a large hollow leaf,
partly poured it between the pearly teeth, which
he parted timidly with his little finger, and partly
sprinkled it over the maiden's face and bosom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
At length a sigh shook her frame&mdash;so soft, so
gentle that a lover's senses alone could have discerned
it; and then, after an interval of perfect
tranquillity, her eyes opened, gazed for a moment
at the youth, and closed not in weakness, but as
if dazzled by his beauty. Gadallah bent over
her, watching for the least motion, the least indication
of returning consciousness; listening for
the first word, the first murmur that might break
from those lips which he had tasted without warrant.
He waited long, but not in vain; for at
last there came a sweet smile, and a small, low
voice cried, "Sabrea! where is Sabrea?" Gadallah
now cast more water, and succeeded in restoring
Hosneh to perfect consciousness, and to
modest fear.</p>

<p>He sat at her feet and told her what had happened,
omitting no one thing&mdash;not even the love
which he had conceived for her; and he promised,
in the absence of her friends, to attend upon
her with respect and devotion, until her strength
and health should return. She was but a child
in years, and innocent as are the angels; and
hearing the frankness of his speech, consented to
what he proposed. And he attended her that
day and the next, until she was able to rise upon
her couch, and sit and talk in a low voice with
him of love. He found every thing that was
required in the way of food amply stored in the
house, the gates of which he closed, lest robbers
might enter; but he did not often go into it, for
fear of the infection, and this was his excuse for
not returning once to his parents' house, lest he
might carry death with him.</p>

<p>On the fourth day Hosneh was well enough to
walk a little in the garden, supported by the arms
of Gadallah, who now wished that he might spend
his life in this manner. But the decrees of fate
were not yet accomplished. On the fifth day the
young man became ill; he had sucked the disease
from the lips of Hosneh in that only kiss
which he had ventured; and before the sun went
down, Hosneh was attending on him in despair,
as he had attended on her in hope. She, too,
brought water to bathe his forehead and his lips;
she, too, watched for the signs of returning life,
and as she passed the night by his side, gazing
on his face, often mistook the sickly play of the
moonbeams, as they fell between the trees, for
the smile which she would have given her life to
purchase.</p>

<p>Praise be to God, it was not written that either
of them should die; and not many days afterward,
toward the hour of evening, they were sitting
in another kiosque beside a fountain, pale
and wan it is true, looking more like pensive angels
than mortal beings, but still with hearts full
of happiness that broke out from time to time in
bright smiles, which were reflected from one to
the other as surely as were their forms in the
clear water by which they reclined. Gadallah
held the hand of Hosneh in his, and listened as
she told how her mother had long ago been dead,
how her father loved her, and how he would surely
have died had any harm befallen her. She
praised the courage, and the modesty, and the
gentleness of Gadallah&mdash;for he had spoken despondingly
about the chances of their future
union, and said that when Zen-ed-din returned,
she would relate all that had happened, and fall at
his knees and say, "Father, give me to Gadallah."</p>

<p>The sun had just set, the golden streams that
had been pouring into the garden seemed now
sporting with the clouds overhead; solid shadows
were thickening around; the flowers and the
blossoms breathed forth their most fragrant perfumes;
the last cooing of the drowsy doves was
trembling on all sides; the nightingale was trying
her voice in a few short, melancholy snatches:
it was an hour for delight and joy; and the two
lovers bent their heads closer together; closer,
until their ringlets mingled, and their sighs, and
the glances of their eyes. Then Gadallah suddenly
arose, and said, "Daughter of my master,
let there be a sword placed betwixt me and thee."
And as he spoke, a bright blade gleamed betwixt
him and the abashed maiden; and they were
both seized with strong hands and hurried away.</p>

<p>Zen-ed-din had returned from his journey, and
finding the great gate closed, had come round
with his followers to the garden entrance, which
he easily opened. Struck by the silence of the
whole place, he advanced cautiously until he
heard voices talking in the kiosque. Then he
drew near, and overheard the whole of what had
passed, and admired the modesty and virtue of
Gadallah. He caused him to be seized and
thrown that night into a dark room, that he might
show his power; and he spoke harshly to his
daughter, because of her too great trustfulness,
and her unpermitted love. But when he understood
all that had happened, and had sufficiently
admired the wonderful workings of God's Providence,
he said to himself, "Surely this youth and
this maiden were created one for the other, and
the decrees of fate must be accomplished." So
he took Gadallah forth from his prison, and embraced
him, calling him his son, and sent for his
parents, and told them what had happened, and
they all rejoiced; and in due time the marriage
took place, and it was blessed, and the children's
children of Hosneh and Gadallah still live among
us.</p>

<p>While the excellent sheikh was rapidly running
over the concluding statements of his narrative,
I remember having read the chief incident
in some European tradition&mdash;possibly borrowed,
as so many of our traditions are, from the East&mdash;and
then a single line of one of our poets, who
has versified the story, came unbidden to my
memory; but I could not recollect the poet's
name, nor understand how the train of association
could be so abruptly broken. The line doubtless
describes the first interview of the lover with
the plague-stricken maiden&mdash;it is as follows:</p>

<h2>A BIRD-HUNTING SPIDER.</h2>


<p>When the veracity of any person has been
impugned, it is a duty which we owe to
society, if it lies in our power, to endeavor to
establish it; and when that person is a lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
gallantry redoubles the obligation. Our chivalry
is, on the present occasion, excited in favor of
Madame Merian, who, toward the latter end of
the seventeenth century, and during a two years'
residence in Surinam, employed her leisure in
studying the many interesting forms of winged
and vegetable life indigenous to that prolific
country. After her return to Holland, her native
land, she published the results of her researches.
Her writings, although abounding in
many inaccuracies and seeming fables, contained
much curious and new information; all the more
valuable from the objects of her study having
been, at that period, either entirely unknown to
the naturalists of Europe, or vaguely reported by
stray seafaring visitants; who, with the usual
license of travelers, were more anxious to strike
their hearers with astonishment than to extend
their knowledge.</p>

<p>These works were rendered still more attractive
by numerous plates&mdash;the result of Madame
Merian's artistic skill&mdash;with which they were
profusely embellished. It is one of these which,
with the description accompanying it, has caused
her truth to be called into question by subsequent
writers; who, we must conclude, had either not
the good fortune or the good eyesight to verify
her statements by their own experience. The
illustration to which I allude represents a large
spider carrying off in its jaws a humming-bird,
whose nest appears close at hand, and who had
apparently been seized while sitting on its eggs.</p>

<p>Linn&aelig;us, however, did not doubt the lady, and
called the spider (which belongs to the genus
<i>Mygale</i>), "avicularia" (bird-eating). Whether
this ferocious-looking hunter does occasionally
capture small birds; or whether he subsists entirely
on the wasps, bees, ants, and beetles which
every where abound, what I chanced myself to
see in the forest will help to determine.</p>

<p>Shortly after daybreak, one morning in 1848,
while staying at a wood-cutting establishment
on the Essequibo, a short distance above the
confluence of that river and the Magaruni, we&mdash;a
tall Yorkshireman and myself&mdash;started in our
"wood-skin" to examine some spring hooks
which we had set during the previous evening,
in the embouchure of a neighboring creek. Our
breakfast that morning depended on our success.
Our chagrin may be imagined on finding all the
baits untouched save one; and from that, some
lurking cayman had snapped the body of the captured
fish, leaving nothing but the useless head
dangling in the air. After mentally dispatching
our spoiler&mdash;who had not tricked us for the first
time&mdash;to a place very far distant, we paddled
further up the creek in search of a maam, or
maroudi; or, indeed, of any thing eatable&mdash;bird,
beast, or reptile. We had not proceeded far,
when my companion, Blottle, who was sitting,
gun in hand, prepared to deal destruction on the
first living creature we might chance to encounter&mdash;suddenly
fired at some object moving rapidly
along the topmost branch of a tree which
overhung the sluggish stream a short way in
advance. For a moment or two the success of
his aim seemed doubtful; then something came
tumbling through the intervening foliage, and I
guided the canoe beneath, lest the prey should
be lost in the water. Our surprise was not unmingled,
I must confess, with vexation at first,
on finding that the strange character of our game
removed our morning's repast as far off as ever.
A huge spider and a half-fledged bird lay in the
bottom of our canoe&mdash;the one with disjointed
limbs and mutilated carcass; the other uninjured
by the shot, but nearly dead, though still faintly
palpitating. The remains of the spider showed
him larger than any I had previously seen&mdash;smaller,
however, than one from Brazil, before
me while I write&mdash;and may have measured some
two-and-half inches in the body, with limbs about
twice that length. He was rough and shaggy,
with a thick covering of hair or bristles; which,
besides giving him an additional appearance of
strength, considerably increased the fierceness
of his aspect. The hairs were in some parts
fully an inch long, of a dark brown color, inclining
to black. His powerful jaws and sturdy
arms seemed never adapted for the death-struggle
of prey less noble than this small member of
the feathered race, for whom our succor had unhappily
arrived too late. The victim had been
snatched from the nest while the mother was
probably assisting to collect a morning's meal
for her offspring. It had been clutched by the
neck immediately above the shoulders: the marks
of the murderer's talons still remained; and, although
no blood had escaped from the wounds,
they were much inflamed and swollen.</p>

<p>The few greenish-brown feathers sparingly
scattered among the down in the wings, were
insufficient to furnish me with a clew toward a
knowledge of its species. That it was a humming-bird,
however, or one of an allied genus,
seemed apparent from the length of its bill.
The king of the humming-birds, as the Creoles
call the topaz-throat (<i>Trochilus pella</i> of naturalists),
is the almost exclusive frequenter of Marabella
Creek, where the overspreading foliage&mdash;here
and there admitting stray gleams of sunshine&mdash;forms
a cool and shady, though sombre
retreat, peculiarly adapted to his disposition;
and I strongly suspect that it was the nest of
this species which the spider had favored with
a visit. After making a minute inspection of
the two bodies, we consigned them to a watery
grave; both of us convinced that, whatever the
detractors of Madame Merian may urge, that
lady was correct in assigning to the bush-spider
an ambition which often soars above the insect,
and occasionally tempts him to make a meal of
some stray feathered denizen of the forest. This
conclusion, I may add, was fully confirmed some
few weeks after, by my witnessing a still more
interesting rencontre between members of the
several races. "Eat the eater," is one of Nature's
laws; and, after preventing its accomplishment
by depriving the spider of his food,
strict justice would probably have balked us of
ours. Fortunately not&mdash;one of the heartiest
breakfasts I ever made, and one of the tenderest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and most succulent of meat, was that very morning.
Well I remember exclaiming, at that time,
"<i>H&aelig;c olim meminisse juvabit!</i>"&mdash;it was my first
dish of stewed monkey and yams.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>PROMISE UNFULFILLED.&mdash;A TALE OF THE COAST-GUARD.</h2>


<p>The <i>Rose</i> had been becalmed for several days
in Cowes Harbor, and utterly at a loss how
else to cheat the time, I employed myself one
afternoon in sauntering up and down the quay,
whistling for a breeze, and listlessly watching
the slow approach of a row-boat, bringing the
mail and a few passengers from Southampton,
the packet-cutter to which the boat belonged
being as hopelessly immovable, except for such
drift as the tide gave her, as the <i>Rose</i>. The
slowness of its approach&mdash;for I expected a messenger
with letters&mdash;added to my impatient weariness;
and as, according to my reckoning, it
would be at least an hour before the boat reached
the landing-steps, I returned to the Fountain Inn
in the High-street, called for a glass of negus,
and as I lazily sipped it, once more turned over
the newspapers lying on the table, though with
scarcely a hope of coming athwart a line that I
had not read half a dozen times before. I was
mistaken. There was a "Cornwall Gazette"
among them which I had not before seen, and in
one corner of it I lit upon this, to me in all respects
new and extremely interesting paragraph:
"We copy the following statement from a contemporary,
solely for the purpose of contradicting
it: 'It is said that the leader of the smugglers
in the late desperate affray with the coast
guard in St. Michael's Bay, was no other than
Mr. George Polwhele Hendrick, of Lostwithiel,
formerly, as our readers are aware, a lieutenant
in the royal navy, and dismissed the king's service
by sentence of court-martial at the close of
the war.' There is no foundation for this imputation.
Mrs. Hendrick, of Lostwithiel, requests
us to state that her son, from whom she heard
but about ten days since, commands a first-class
ship in the merchant navy of the United States."</p>

<p>I was exceedingly astonished. The court-martial
I had not heard of, and having never
overhauled the Navy List for such a purpose,
the absence of the name of G. P. Hendrick had
escaped my notice. What could have been his
offense? Some hasty, passionate act, no doubt;
for of misbehavior before the enemy, or of the
commission of deliberate wrong, it was impossible
to suspect him. He was, I personally knew,
as eager as flame in combat; and his frank, perhaps
heedless generosity of temperament, was
abundantly apparent to every one acquainted
with him. I had known him for a short time
only; but the few days of our acquaintance were
passed under circumstances which bring out the
true nature of a man more prominently and unmistakably
than might twenty years of humdrum,
every-day life. The varnish of pretension
falls quickly off in presence of sudden and extreme
peril&mdash;peril especially requiring presence
of mind and energy to beat it back. It was in
such a position that I recognized some of the
high qualities of Lieutenant Hendrick. The two
sloops of war in which we respectively served,
were consorts for awhile on the South African
coast, during which time we fell in with a Franco-Italian
privateer or pirate&mdash;for the distinction
between the two is much more technical than
real. She was to leeward when we sighted her,
and not very distant from the shore, and so quickly
did she shoal her water, that pursuit by either
of the sloops was out of the question. Being a
stout vessel of her class, and full of men, four
boats&mdash;three of the <i>Scorpion's</i> and one of her consort's&mdash;were
detached in pursuit. The breeze
gradually failed, and we were fast coming up
with our friend when he vanished behind a head-land,
on rounding which we found he had disappeared
up a narrow, winding river, of no great
depth of water. We of course followed, and, after
about a quarter of an hour's hard pull, found, on
suddenly turning a sharp elbow of the stream, that
we had caught a Tartar. We had, in fact, come
upon a complete nest of privateers&mdash;a rendezvous
or d&eacute;p&ocirc;t they termed it. The vessel was already
anchored across the channel, and we were
flanked on each shore by a crowd of desperadoes,
well provided with small arms, and with two or
three pieces of light ordnance among them. The
shouts of defiance with which they greeted us as
we swept into the deadly trap were instantly
followed by a general and murderous discharge
of both musketry and artillery; and as the smoke
cleared away I saw that the leading pinnace, commanded
by Hendrick, had been literally knocked
to pieces, and that the little living portion of
the crew were splashing about in the river.</p>

<p>There was time but for one look, for if we allowed
the rascals time to reload their guns our
own fate would inevitably be a similar one. The
men understood this, and with a loud cheer swept
eagerly on toward the privateer, while the two remaining
boats engaged the flanking shore forces,
and I was soon involved in about the fiercest
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> I ever had the honor to assist at. The furious
struggle on the deck of the privateer lasted
but about five minutes only, at the end of which
all that remained of us were thrust over the side.
Some tumbled into the boat, others, like myself,
were pitched into the river. As soon as I came
to the surface, and had time to shake my ears
and look about me, I saw Lieutenant Hendrick,
who, the instant the pinnace he commanded was
destroyed, had, with equal daring and presence
of mind, swam toward a boat at the privateer's
stern, cut the rope that held her, with the sword
he carried between his teeth, and forthwith began
picking up his half-drowned boat's crew. This
was already accomplished, and he now performed
the same service for me and mine. This done,
we again sprang at our ugly customer, he at the
bow, and I about midships. Hendrick was the
first to leap on the enemy's deck; and so fierce
and well-sustained was the assault this time, that
in less than ten minutes we were undisputed
victors so far as the vessel was concerned. The
fight on the shore continued obstinate and bloody,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and it was not till we had twice discharged the
privateer's guns among the desperate rascals
that they broke and fled. The dashing, yet cool
and skillful bravery evinced by Lieutenant Hendrick
in this brief but tumultuous and sanguinary
affair was admiringly remarked upon by all who
witnessed it, few of whom while gazing at the
sinewy, active form, the fine, pale, flashing countenance,
and the dark, thunderous eyes of the
young officer&mdash;if I may use such a term, for in
their calmest aspect a latent volcano appeared to
slumber in their gleaming depths&mdash;could refuse
to subscribe to the opinion of a distinguished admiral,
who more than once observed that there
was no more promising officer in the British naval
service than Lieutenant Hendrick.</p>

<p>Well, all this, which has taken me so many
words to relate, flashed before me like a scene
in a theatre, as I read the paragraph in the
Cornish paper. The <i>Scorpion</i> and her consort
parted company a few days after this fight, and
I had not since then seen or heard of Hendrick
till now. I was losing myself in conjecture as
to the probable or possible cause of so disgraceful
a termination to a career that promised so
brilliantly, when the striking of the bar-clock
warned me that the mail-boat was by this time
arrived. I sallied forth and reached the pier-steps
just a minute or so before the boat arrived
there. The messenger I expected was in her,
and I was turning away with the parcel he handed
me, when my attention was arrested by a
stout, unwieldy fellow, who stumbled awkwardly
out of the boat, and hurriedly came up the
steps. The face of the man was pale, thin,
hatchet-shaped, and anxious, and the gray, ferrety
eyes were restless and perturbed; while the
stout round body was that of a yeoman of the
bulkiest class, but so awkwardly made up that
it did not require any very lengthened scrutiny
to perceive that the shrunken carcass appropriate
to such a lanky and dismal visage occupied but
a small space within the thick casing of padding
and extra garments in which it was swathed.
His light-brown wig, too, surmounted by a broad-brimmer,
had got a little awry, dangerously revealing
the scanty locks of iron-gray beneath.
It was not difficult to run up these little items
to a pretty accurate sum total, and I had little
doubt that the hasting and nervous traveler was
fleeing either from a constable or a sheriff's officer.
It was, however, no affair of mine, and I
was soon busy with the letters just brought me.</p>

<p>The most important tidings they contained was
that Captain Pickard&mdash;the master of a smuggling
craft of some celebrity, called <i>Les Trois Fr&egrave;res</i>,
in which for the last twelve months or more he
had been carrying on a daring and successful
trade throughout the whole line of the southern
and western coasts&mdash;was likely to be found at
this particular time near a particular spot in the
back of the Wight. This information was from
a sure source in the enemy's camp, and it was
consequently with great satisfaction that I observed
indications of the coming on of a breeze,
and in all probability a stiff one. I was not disappointed;
and in less than an hour the <i>Rose</i>
was stretching her white wings beneath a brisk
northwester over to Portsmouth, where I had
some slight official business to transact previous
to looking after friend Pickard. This was speedily
dispatched, and I was stepping into the boat
on my return to the cutter, when a panting messenger
informed me that the port-admiral desired
to see me instantly.</p>

<p>"The telegraph has just announced," said the
admiral, "that Sparkes, the defaulter, who has
for some time successfully avoided capture, will
attempt to leave the kingdom from the Wight,
as he is known to have been in communication
with some of the smuggling gentry there. He
is supposed to have a large amount of government
moneys in his possession; you will therefore,
Lieutenant Warneford, exert yourself vigilantly
to secure him."</p>

<p>"What is his description?"</p>

<p>"Mr. James," replied the admiral, addressing
one of the telegraph clerks, "give Lieutenant
Warneford the description transmitted." Mr.
James did so, and I read: "Is said to have disguised
himself as a stout countryman; wears a
blue coat with bright buttons, buff waistcoat, a
brown wig, and a Quaker's hat. He is of a
slight, lanky figure, five feet nine inches in height.
He has two pock-marks on his forehead, and lisps
in his speech."</p>

<p>"By Jove, sir," I exclaimed, "I saw this fellow
only about two hours ago!" I then briefly
related what had occurred, and was directed not
to lose a moment in hastening to secure the
fugitive.</p>

<p>The wind had considerably increased by this
time, and the <i>Rose</i> was soon again off Cowes,
where Mr. Roberts, the first mate, and six men,
were sent on shore with orders to make the best
of his way to Bonchurch&mdash;about which spot I
knew, if any where, the brown-wigged gentleman
would endeavor to embark&mdash;while the <i>Rose</i>
went round to intercept him seaward; which
she did at a spanking rate, for it was now blowing
half a gale of wind. Evening had fallen before
we reached our destination, but so clear and
bright with moon and stars that distant objects
were as visible as by day. I had rightly guessed
how it would be, for we had no sooner opened
up Bonchurch shore or beach than Roberts signaled
us that our man was on board the cutter
running off at about a league from us in the direction
of Cape La Hogue. I knew, too, from
the cutter's build, and the cut and set of her
sails, that she was no other than Captain Pickard's
boasted craft, so that there was a chance
of killing two birds with one stone. We evidently
gained, though slowly, upon <i>Les Trois
Fr&egrave;res</i>; and this, after about a quarter of an
hour's run, appeared to be her captain's own
opinion, for he suddenly changed his course, and
stood toward the Channel Islands, in the hope,
I doubted not, that I should not follow him in
such weather as was likely to come on through
the dangerous intricacies of the iron-bound coast
about Guernsey and the adjacent islets. Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Pickard was mistaken; for knowing the extreme
probability of being led such a dance, I had
brought a pilot with me from Cowes, as well acquainted
with Channel navigation as the smuggler
himself could be. <i>Les Trois Fr&egrave;res</i>, it was
soon evident, was now upon her best point of
sailing, and it was all that we could do to hold
our own with her. This was vexatious; but
the aspect of the heavens forbade me showing
more canvas, greatly as I was tempted to do so.</p>

<p>It was lucky I did not. The stars were still
shining over our heads from an expanse of blue
without a cloud, and the full moon also as yet held
her course unobscured, but there had gathered
round her a glittering halo-like ring, and away
to windward huge masses of black cloud, piled
confusedly on each other, were fast spreading
over the heavens. The thick darkness had spread
over about half the visible sky, presenting a singular
contrast to the silver brightness of the
other portion, when suddenly a sheet of vivid
flame broke out of the blackness, instantly followed
by deafening explosions, as if a thousand
cannons were bursting immediately over our
heads. At the same moment the tempest came
leaping and hissing along the white-crested
waves, and struck the <i>Rose</i> abeam with such
terrible force, that for one startling moment I
doubted if she would right again. It was a vain
fear; and in a second or two she was tearing
through the water at a tremendous rate. <i>Les
Trois Fr&egrave;res</i> had not been so lucky: she had
carried away her topmast, and sustained other
damage; but so well and boldly was she handled,
and so perfectly under command appeared her
crew, that these accidents were, so far as it was
possible to do so, promptly repaired; and so little
was she crippled in comparative speed, that,
although it was clear enough after a time, that
the <i>Rose</i> gained something on her, it was so
slowly that the issue of the chase continued
extremely doubtful. The race was an exciting
one: the Caskets, Alderney, were swiftly past,
and at about two o'clock in the morning we made
the Guernsey lights. We were, by this time,
within a mile of <i>Les Trois Fr&egrave;res</i>; and she, determined
at all risks to get rid of her pursuer,
ventured upon passing through a narrow opening
between the small islets of Herm and Jethon,
abreast of Guernsey&mdash;the same passage, I believe,
by which Captain, afterward Admiral Lord
Saumarez, escaped with his frigate from a French
squadron in the early days of the last war.</p>

<p>Fine and light as the night had again become,
the attempt, blowing as it did, was a perilous,
and proved to be a fatal one. <i>Les Trois Fr&egrave;res</i>
struck upon a reef on the side of Jethon&mdash;a rock
with then but one poor habitation upon it, which
one might throw a biscuit over; and by the time
the <i>Rose</i> had brought up in the Guernsey Roads,
the smuggler, as far as could be ascertained by our
night-glasses, had entirely disappeared. What
had become of the crew and the important passenger
was the next point to be ascertained; but
although the wind had by this time somewhat
abated, it was not, under the pilot's advice, till
near eight o'clock that the <i>Rose's</i> boat, with myself
and a stout crew, pulled off for the scene of
the catastrophe. We needed not to have hurried
ourselves. The half-drowned smugglers, all but
three of whom had escaped with life, were in a
truly sorry plight, every one of them being more
or less maimed, bruised, and bleeding. <i>Les Trois
Fr&egrave;res</i> had gone entirely to pieces, and as there
was no possible means of escape from the desolate
place, our arrival, with the supplies we brought,
was looked upon rather as a deliverance than
otherwise. To my inquiries respecting their
passenger, the men answered by saying he was
in the house with the captain. I immediately
proceeded thither, and found one of the two rooms
on the ground-floor occupied by four or five of the
worst injured of the contrabandists, and the gentleman
I was chiefly in pursuit of, Mr. Samuel
Sparkes. There was no mistaking Mr. Sparkes,
notwithstanding he had substituted the disguise
of a sailor for that of a jolly agriculturist.</p>

<p>"You are, I believe, sir, the Mr. Samuel Sparkes
for whose presence certain personages in London
are just now rather anxious?"</p>

<p>His deathy face grew more corpse-like as I
spoke, but he nevertheless managed to stammer
out, "No; Jamth Edward, thir."</p>

<p>"At all events, that pretty lisp, and those two
marks on the forehead, belong to Samuel Sparkes,
Esquire, and you must be detained till you satisfactorily
explain how you came by them. Stevens,
take this person into close custody, and have him
searched at once. And now, gentlemen smugglers,"
I continued, "pray, inform me where I
may see your renowned captain?"</p>

<p>"He is in the next room," replied a decent-tongued
chap sitting near the fire; "and he desired
me to give his compliments to Lieutenant
Warneford, and say he wished to see him <i>alone</i>."</p>

<p>"Very civil and considerate, upon my word!
In this room, do you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; in that room." I pushed open a
rickety door, and found myself in a dingy hole
of a room, little more than about a couple of yards
square, at the further side of which stood a lithe,
sinewy man in a blue pea-jacket, and with a fur-cap
on his head. His back was toward me; and
as my entrance did not cause him to change his
position, I said, "You are Captain Pickard, I am
informed?"</p>

<p>He swung sharply round as I spoke, threw off
his cap, and said, briefly and sternly, "Yes,
Warneford, I <i>am</i> Captain Pickard."</p>

<p>The sudden unmasking of a loaded battery
immediately in my front could not have so confounded
and startled me as these words did, as
they issued from the lips of the man before me.
The curling black hair, the dark flashing eyes,
the marble features, were those of Lieutenant
Hendrick&mdash;of the gallant seaman whose vigorous
arm I had seen turn the tide of battle against
desperate odds on the deck of a privateer!</p>

<p>"Hendrick!" I at length exclaimed, for the
sudden inrush of painful emotion choked my
speech for a time&mdash;"can it indeed be you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, truly, Warneford. The Hendrick of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
whom Collingwood prophesied high things is
fallen thus low; and worse remains behind.
There is a price set upon my capture, as you
know; and escape is, I take it, out of the question."
I comprehended the slow, meaning tone
in which the last sentence was spoken, and the
keen glance that accompanied it. Hendrick, too,
instantly read the decisive though unspoken reply.</p>

<p>"Of course it is out of the question," he went
on. "I was but a fool to even seem to doubt
that it was. You must do your duty, Warneford,
I know; and since this fatal mishap was to occur,
I am glad for many reasons that I have fallen into
your hands."</p>

<p>"So am not I; and I wish with all my soul
you had successfully threaded the passage you
essayed."</p>

<p>"The fellow who undertook to pilot us failed
in nerve at the critical moment. Had he not
done so, <i>Les Trois Fr&egrave;res</i> would have been long
since beyond your reach. But the past is past,
and the future of dark and bitter time will be swift
and brief."</p>

<p>"What have you especially to dread? I know
a reward has been offered for your apprehension,
but not for what precise offense."</p>

<p>"The unfortunate business in St. Michael's
Bay."</p>

<p>"Good God! The newspaper was right,
then! But neither of the wounded men have
died, I hear, so that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The <i>mercy</i> of transportation may, you think,
be substituted for the capital penalty." He
laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;or," I hesitatingly suggested, "you may
not be identified&mdash;that is, legally so."</p>

<p>"Easily, easily, Warneford. I must not trust
to that rotten cable. Neither the coast-guard nor
the fellows with me know me indeed as Hendrick,
ex-lieutenant of the royal navy; and that is a
secret you will, I know, religiously respect."</p>

<p>I promised to do so: the painful interview
terminated; and in about two hours the captain
and surviving crew of <i>Les Trois Fr&egrave;res</i>, and Mr.
Samuel Sparkes, were safely on board the <i>Rose</i>.
Hendrick had papers to arrange; and as the
security of his person was all I was responsible
for, he was accommodated in my cabin, where I
left him to confer with the Guernsey authorities,
in whose bailiwick Jethon is situated. The matter
of jurisdiction&mdash;the offenses with which the
prisoners were charged having been committed
in England&mdash;was soon arranged; and by five
o'clock in the evening the <i>Rose</i> was on her way
to England, under an eight-knot breeze from the
southwest.</p>

<p>As soon as we were fairly underweigh, I went
below to have a last conference with unfortunate
Hendrick. There was a parcel on the table directed
to "Mrs. Hendrick, Lostwithiel, Cornwall,
care of Lieutenant Warneford." Placing it in
my hands, he entreated me to see it securely
conveyed to its address unexamined and unopened.
I assured him that I would do so; and tears,
roughly dashed away, sprang to his eyes as he
grasped and shook my hand. I felt half-choked;
and when he again solemnly adjured me, under
no circumstances, to disclose the identity of Captain
Pickard and Lieutenant Hendrick, I could
only reply by a seaman's hand-grip, requiring no
additional pledge of words.</p>

<p>We sat silently down, and I ordered some wine
to be brought in. "You promised to tell me,"
I said, "how all this unhappy business came
about."</p>

<p>"I am about to do so," he answered. "It is
an old tale, of which the last black chapter owes
its color, let me frankly own, to my own hot and
impatient temper as much as to a complication of
adverse circumstances." He poured out a glass
of wine, and proceeded at first slowly and calmly,
but gradually, as passion gathered strength
and way upon him, with flushed and impetuous
eagerness to the close:</p>

<p>"I was born near Lostwithiel, Cornwall. My
father, a younger and needy son of no profession,
died when I was eight years of age. My mother
has about eighty pounds a year in her own right,
and with that pittance, helped by self-privation,
unfelt because endured for her darling boy, she
gave me a sufficient education, and fitted me out
respectably; when, thanks to Pellew, I obtained
a midshipman's warrant in the British service.
This occurred in my sixteenth year. Dr. Redstone,
at whose 'High School' I acquired what
slight classical learning, long since forgotten, I
once possessed, was married in second nuptials
to a virago of a wife, who brought him, besides
her precious self, a red-headed cub by a former
marriage. His, the son's, name was Kershaw.
The doctor had one child about my own age, a
daughter, Ellen Redstone. I am not about to
prate to you of the bread-and-butter sentiment
of mere children, nor of Ellen's wonderful graces
of mind and person: I doubt, indeed, if I thought
her very pretty at the time; but she was meekness
itself, and my boy's heart used, I well remember,
to leap as if it would burst my bosom
at witnessing her patient submission to the tyranny
of her mother-in-law; and one of the
greatest pleasures I ever experienced was giving
young Kershaw, a much bigger fellow than myself,
a good thrashing for some brutality toward
her&mdash;an exploit that of course rendered me a
remarkable favorite with the great bumpkin's
mother.</p>

<p>"Well, I went to sea, and did not again see
Ellen till seven years afterward, when, during
absence on sick leave, I met her at Penzance,
in the neighborhood of which place the doctor
had for some time resided. She was vastly improved
in person, but was still meek, dove-eyed,
gentle Ellen, and pretty nearly as much dominated
by her mother-in-law as formerly. Our
child-acquaintance was renewed; and, suffice it
to say, that I soon came to love her with a fervency
surprising even to myself. My affection was
reciprocated: we pledged faith with each other;
and it was agreed that at the close of the war,
whenever that should be, we were to marry, and
dwell together like turtle-doves in the pretty hermitage
that Ellen's fancy loved to conjure up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and with her voice of music untiringly dilate
upon. I was again at sea, and the answer to
my first letter brought the surprising intelligence
that Mrs. Redstone had become quite reconciled
to our future union, and that I might consequently
send my letters direct to the High School.
Ellen's letter was prettily expressed enough, but
somehow I did not like its tone. It did not read
like her spoken language, at all events. This,
however, must, I concluded, be mere fancy; and
our correspondence continued for a couple of
years&mdash;till the peace, in fact&mdash;when the frigate,
of which I was now second-lieutenant, arrived at
Plymouth to be paid off. We were awaiting the
admiral's inspection, which for some reason or
other was unusually delayed, when a bag of letters
was brought on board, with one for me bearing
the Penzance postmark. I tore it open, and
found that it was subscribed by an old and intimate
friend. He had accidentally met with Ellen
Redstone for the first time since I left. She
looked thin and ill, and in answer to his persistent
questioning, had told him she had only heard
once from me since I went to sea, and that was
to renounce our engagement; and she added that
she was going to be married in a day or two to
the Rev. Mr. Williams, a dissenting minister of
fair means and respectable character. My friend
assured her there must be some mistake, but she
shook her head incredulously; and with eyes
brimful of tears, and shaking voice, bade him,
when he saw me, say that she freely forgave me,
but that her heart was broken. This was the
substance, and as I read, a hurricane of dismay
and rage possessed me. There was not, I felt,
a moment to be lost. Unfortunately the captain
was absent, and the frigate temporarily under the
command of the first-lieutenant. You knew
Lieutenant &mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I did, for one of the most cold-blooded martinets
that ever trod a quarter-deck."</p>

<p>"Well, him I sought, and asked temporary
leave of absence. He refused. I explained, hurriedly,
imploringly explained the circumstances
in which I was placed. He sneeringly replied,
that sentimental nonsense of that kind could not
be permitted to interfere with the king's service.
You know, Warneford, how naturally hot and
impetuous is my temper, and at that moment my
brain seemed literally aflame: high words followed,
and in a transport of rage I struck the
taunting coward a violent blow in the face&mdash;following
up the outrage by drawing my sword, and
challenging him to instant combat. You may
guess the sequel. I was immediately arrested
by the guard, and tried a few days afterward by
court-martial. Exmouth stood my friend, or I
know not what sentence might have been passed,
and I was dismissed the service."</p>

<p>"I was laid up for several weeks by fever
about that time," I remarked; "and it thus happened,
doubtless, that I did not see any report of
the trial."</p>

<p>"The moment I was liberated I hastened, literally
almost in a state of madness, to Penzance.
It was all true, and I was too late! Ellen had
been married something more than a week. It
was Kershaw and his mother's doings. Him I
half-killed; but it is needless to go into details
of the frantic violence with which I conducted
myself. I broke madly into the presence of the
newly-married couple: Ellen swooned with terror,
and her husband, white with consternation,
and trembling in every limb, had barely, I remember,
sufficient power to stammer out, 'that he
would pray for me.' The next six months is a
blank. I went to London; fell into evil courses,
drank, gambled; heard after a while that Ellen
was dead&mdash;the shock of which partially checked
my downward progress&mdash;partially only. I left
off drinking, but not gambling, and ultimately I
became connected with a number of disreputable
persons, among whom was your prisoner Sparkes.
He found part of the capital with which I have
been carrying on the contraband trade for the
last two years. I had, however, fully determined
to withdraw myself from the dangerous though
exciting pursuit. This was to have been my last
trip; but you know," he added, bitterly, "it is
always upon the last turn of the dice that the
devil wins his victim."</p>

<p>He ceased speaking, and we both remained
silent for several minutes. What on my part
<i>could</i> be said or suggested?</p>

<p>"You hinted just now," I remarked, after a
while, "that all your remaining property was in
this parcel. You have, however, of course, reserved
sufficient for your defense?"</p>

<p>A strange smile curled his lip, and a wild, brief
flash of light broke from his dark eyes, as he answered,
"O yes; more than enough&mdash;more, much
more than will be required."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that." We were again silent,
and I presently exclaimed, "Suppose we take a
turn on deck&mdash;the heat here stifles one."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," he answered; and we
both left the cabin.</p>

<p>We continued to pace the deck side by side for
some time without interchanging a syllable. The
night was beautifully clear and fine, and the cool
breeze that swept over the star and moon-lit
waters gradually allayed the feverish nervousness
which the unfortunate lieutenant's narrative
had excited.</p>

<p>"A beautiful, however illusive world," he by-and-by
sadly resumed; "this Death&mdash;now so
close at my heels&mdash;wrenches us from. And yet
you and I, Warneford, have seen men rush to
encounter the King of Terrors, as he is called,
as readily as if summoned to a bridal."</p>

<p>"A sense of duty and a habit of discipline will
always overpower, in men of our race and profession,
the vulgar fear of death."</p>

<p>"Is it not also, think you, the greater fear of
disgrace, dishonor in the eyes of the world, which
outweighs the lesser dread?"</p>

<p>"No doubt that has an immense influence.
What would our sweethearts, sisters, mothers,
say if they heard we had turned craven? What
would they say in England? Nelson well understood
this feeling, and appealed to it in his
last great signal."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure," he musingly replied; "what
would our mothers say&mdash;feel rather&mdash;at witnessing
their sons' dishonor? That is the master-chord."
We once more relapsed into silence;
and after another dozen or so turns on the deck,
Hendrick seated himself on the combings of the
main hatchway. His countenance, I observed,
was still pale as marble, but a livelier, more resolute
expression had gradually kindled in his
brilliant eyes. He was, I concluded, nerving himself
to meet the chances of his position with constancy
and fortitude.</p>

<p>"I shall go below again," I said. "Come; it
may be some weeks before we have another glass
of wine together."</p>

<p>"I will be with you directly," he answered, and
I went down. He did not, however, follow, and
I was about calling him, when I heard his step
on the stairs. He stopped at the threshold of
the cabin, and there was a flushing intensity of
expression about his face which quite startled
me. As if moved by second thoughts, he stepped
in. "One last glass with you, Warneford:
God bless you!" He drained and set the glass on
the table. "The lights at the corner of the
Wight are just made," he hurriedly went on.
"It is not likely I shall have an opportunity of
again speaking with you; and let me again hear
you say that you will under any circumstances
keep secret from all the world&mdash;my mother especially&mdash;that
Captain Pickard and Lieutenant
Hendrick were one person."</p>

<p>"I will; but why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God bless you!" he broke in. "I must go on
deck again."</p>

<p>He vanished as he spoke, and a dim suspicion
of his purpose arose in my mind; but before I
could act upon it, a loud, confused outcry arose
on the deck, and as I rushed up the cabin stairs,
I heard amid the hurrying to and fro of feet, the
cries of "Man overboard!"&mdash;"Bout ship!"&mdash;"Down
with the helm!" The cause of the commotion
was soon explained: Hendrick had sprung
overboard; and looking in the direction pointed
out by the man at the wheel, I plainly discerned
him already considerably astern of the cutter.
His face was turned toward us, and the instant
I appeared he waved one arm wildly in the air:
I could hear the words, "Your promise!" distinctly,
and the next instant the moonlight played
upon the spot where he had vanished. Boats
were lowered, and we passed and repassed over
and near the place for nearly half an hour. Vainly:
he did not reappear.</p>

<p>I have only further to add, that the parcel intrusted
to me was safely delivered, and that I
have reason to believe Mrs. Hendrick remained
to her last hour ignorant of the sad fate of her
son. It was her impression, induced by his last
letter, that he was about to enter the South-American
service under Cochrane, and she ultimately
resigned herself to a belief that he had
there met a brave man's death. My promise was
scrupulously kept, nor is it by this publication in
the slightest degree broken; for both the names
of Hendrick and Pickard are fictitious, and so is
the place assigned as that of the lieutenant's
birth. That rascal Sparkes, I am glad to be able
to say&mdash;chasing whom made me an actor in the
melancholy affair&mdash;was sent over the herring
pond for life.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE TUB SCHOOL.</h2>


<p>Speaking without passion, we are bound to
state, in broad terms, that the founder of the
Diogenic philosophy was emphatically a humbug.
Some people might call him by a harsher name;
we content ourselves with the popular vernacular.
Formidable as he was&mdash;this unwashed dog-baptized&mdash;with
a kind of savage grandeur, too,
about his independence and his fearlessness&mdash;still
was he a humbug; setting forth fancies for
facts, and judging all men by the measure of one.
Manifestly afflicted with a liver complaint, his
physical disorders wore the mask of mental power,
and a state of body that required a course of
calomel or a dose of purifying powders, passed
current in the world for intellectual superiority;
not a rare case in times when madness was accounted
potent inspiration, and when the exhibition
of mesmeric phenomena formed the title
of the Pythoness to her mystic tripod.</p>

<p>Diogenes is not the only man whose disturbed
digestion has led multitudes, like an <i>ignis fatuus</i>,
into the bogs and marshes of falsehood. Abundance
of sects are about, which their respective
followers class under one generic head of inspiration,
but which have sprung from the same
hepatic inaction, or epigrastic inflammation, as
that which made the cynic believe in the divinity
of dirt, and see in a tub the fittest temple to virtue.
All that narrows the sympathies&mdash;all that
makes a man think better of himself than of his
"neighbors"&mdash;all that compresses the illimitable
mercy of God into a small talisman which you
and your followers alone possess&mdash;all that creates
condemnation&mdash;is of the Diogenic Tub School;
corrupt in the core, and rotten in the root&mdash;fruit,
leaves, and flowers, the heritage of death.</p>

<p>A superstitious reverence for a bilious condition
of body, and an abhorrence of soap and
water, as savoring of idolatry or of luxury&mdash;according
to the dress and nation of the Cynic&mdash;made
up the fundamental ideas of his school;
and to this day they are the cabala of one division
of the sect. We confess not to be able to see
much beauty in either of these conditions, and
are rather proud than otherwise of our state of
disbelief; holding health and cleanliness in high
honor, and hoping much of moral improvement
from their better preservation. But to the Tub
School, good digestive powers, and their consequence,
good temper, were evidences of lax principles,
and cleanliness was ungodliness or effeminacy;
as the unpurified denouncer prayed to
St. Giles, or sacrificed to Venus Cloacina. Take
the old monks as an example. Not that we are
about to condemn the whole Catholic Church
under a cowled mask. She has valuable men
among her sons; but, in such a large body,
there must of necessity be some members weaker
than the rest; and the mendicant friars, and do-nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
monks, were about the weakest and the
worst that ever appeared by the Catholic altar.
They were essentially of the Tub School, as
false to the best purposes of mankind as the
famous old savage of Alexander's time. Dirt
and vanity, bile and condemnation, were the
paternosters of their litany; and what else lay
in the tub which the king over-shadowed from
the sun? All the accounts of which we read, of
pious horror of baths and washhouses&mdash;all the
frantic renunciation of laundresses, and the belief
in hair shirts, to the prejudice of honest linen&mdash;all
the religious zeal against small-tooth combs,
and the sin which lay in razors and nail-brushes&mdash;all
the holy preference given to coarse cobbling
of skins of beasts, over civilized tailoring of seemly
garments&mdash;all the superiority of bare feet,
which never knew the meaning of a pediluvium,
over those which shoes and hose kept warm,
and foot-baths rendered clean&mdash;all the hatred of
madness against the refinements of life, and the
cultivation of the beautiful: these were the evidences
of the Diogenic philosophy; and of Monachism
too; and of other forms of faith, which
we could name in the same breath. And how
much good was in them? What natural divinity
lies in fur, which the cotton plant does not possess?
Wherein consists the holiness of mud,
and the ungodliness of alkali? wherein the purity
of a matted beard, and the impiety of Metcalfe's
brushes, and Mechi's magic strop? It
may be so; and we all the while may be mentally
blind; and yet, if we lived in a charnel-house,
whose horrors the stony core of a cataract
concealed, we could not wish to be couched, that
seeing, we might understand the frightful conditions
of which blindness kept us ignorant.</p>

<p>But bating the baths and wash-houses, hempen
girdles, and hairy garments, we quarrel still with
the <i>animus</i> of Diogenes and his train. Its social
savageness was bad enough&mdash;its spiritual insolence
was worse. The separatism&mdash;the "stand
off, for I am holier than thou"&mdash;the condemnation
of a whole world, if walking apart from <i>his</i> way&mdash;the
substitution of solitary exaltation for the
activity of charity&mdash;the proud judgment of <span class="smcap">God</span>'S
world, and the presumptuous division into good
and evil of the Eternal; all this was and is of the
Cynic's philosophy; and all this is what we abjure
with heart and soul, as the main link of the
chain which binds men to cruelty, to ignorance,
and to sin; for the unloosing of which we must
wait before we see them fairly in the way of
progress.</p>

<p>How false the religion of condemnation!&mdash;how
hardening to the heart!&mdash;how narrowing to the
sympathies! We take a section for the whole,
and swear that the illimitable All must be according
to the form of the unit I; we make ourselves
gods, and judge of the infinite universe by the
teaching of our finite senses. They who do this
most are they whom men call "zealous for God's
glory," "stern sticklers for the truth," and "haters
of latitudinarianism." And if all the social
charities are swept down in their course, they
are mourned over gently; but only so much as
if they were sparrows lying dead beneath the
blast that slew the enemy. "'Tis a pity," say
they, "that men must be firm to the truth, yet
cruel to their fellows; but if it must be so, why,
let them fall fast as snow-flakes. What is human
life, compared to the preservation of the truth?"
Ah! friends and brothers&mdash;is not the necessity
of cruelty the warrantry of falsehood? The truth
of life is <span class="smcap">Love</span>, and all which negatives love is
false; and every drop of blood that ever flowed
in the preservation of any dogma, bore in its
necessity the condemnation of that dogma.</p>

<p>Turn where we will, and as far backward as
we will, we ever find the spirit of the Diogenic
philosophy; and clothed, too, in much the same
garb and unseemly disorder as that in vogue
among the dog-baptized. Ancient East gives us
many parallels; and to this day, dirty, lazy fakirs
of Hindostan assault the olfactories, and call for
curses on the effeminacy of the cleanly and the
sane. Sometimes, though, the Diogenites assume
the scrupulosity of the Pharisee, and then
they retain only the crimes of the Inquisition,
not the habits and apparel of the Bosjesmen.
Take the sincere Pharisee, for instance; regard
his holy horror of the Samaritan (the Independent
of his day) for failing in the strict letter of the
law; hear his stern denunciations against all
sinners, be they moral or be they doctrinal,
mark the unpitying "Crucify him! crucify him!"
against Him who taught novel doctrines of equality
and brotherhood, and the nullity of form; see
the purity of his own Pharisaic life, and grant
him his proud curse on all that are not like unto
him. He is a Cynic in his heart, one who judges
of universal humanity by the individualism of
one. Then, the hoary, hairy, dog-baptized, who
scoffed at all the decencies of life, not to speak
of its amenities, and had no gentle Plato's pride
of refinement, with all the brutal pride of coarseness&mdash;did
Diogenes worthily represent the best
functions of manhood? Again, the monks and
friars of the dark ages, and the hermits of old,
they who left the world of man "made in the
image of God," because they were holier than
their brethren, and might have naught in common
with the likeness of the Elohim; they who gave
up the deeds of charity for the endless repetition
of masses and vespers, and who thought to do
God better service by mumbling masses in a
cowl, than by living among their fellows, loving,
aiding, and improving&mdash;were not all these followers
in the train of Diogenes?&mdash;if not in the
dirt, then in the bile; if not in the garb, then in
the heart. Denouncers, condemners; narrowing,
not enlarging; hating, not loving; they were
traitors to the virtue of life, while dreaming that
they alone held it sacred.</p>

<p>And now, have we no snarling Cynics, no
Pharisee, no Inquisitor? Have we taken to good
heart the divine record of love, of faith, which an
&aelig;sthetic age has sublimated into credos, and left
actions as a <i>caput mortuum</i>? Have we looked
into the meaning of the practical lesson which
the Master taught when he forgave the adulteress,
and sat at meat with the sinners? or have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
we not rather cherished the spiritual pride which
shapes out bitter words of censure for our fellows,
and lays such stress on likeness that it overlooks
unity? The question is worthy of an answer.</p>

<p>The world is wide. Beasts and fishes, birds
and reptiles, weeds and flowers&mdash;which <i>here</i> are
weeds, and <i>there</i> are flowers, according to local
fancy&mdash;the dwarfed shrub of the Alpine steeps,
and the monster palm of the tropical plains; the
world is wide enough to contain them all, and
man is wise enough to love them all, each in its
sphere, and its degree. But what we do for
Nature, we refuse to Humanity. To her we
allow diversity; to him we prescribe sameness;
in her we see the loveliness of unlikeness, the
symmetry of variation; in him we must have
multitudes shaped by one universal rule; and
what we do not look for in the senseless tree,
we attempt on the immortal soul. Religion,
philosophy, and social politics, must be of the
same form with all men, else woe to the wight
who thinks out of the straight line! Diagonal
minds are never popular, and the hand which
draws one radius smites him who lines another
equal to it in all its parts, and from the same
centre-point. The Catholic denies the Protestant;
the Episcopalian contemns the Presbyterian; the
Free Kirk is shed like a branching horn; the Independent
denounces the Swedenborgian; the
Mormonite is persecuted by the Unitarian. It is
one unvarying round; the same thing called by
different names. Now all this is the very soul
of Diogenism. Cowl, mitre, or band&mdash;distinctive
signs to each party&mdash;all are lost in the shadow
of the tub, and jumbled up into a strange form,
which hath the name of Him of Sinope engraved
on its forehead. Separatism and denunciation
against him who is not with thee in all matters
of faith, make thee, my friend, a Cynic in thy
heart; and, though thou mayst wear Nicoll's
paletots and Medwin's boots, and mayst prank
thyself in all imaginable coxcombries, thou art
still but a Diogenite, a Cynic, and a Pharisee;
washing the outside of the platter, but leaving
the inside encrusted still, believing falsely, that
thou hast naught to do with a cause, because
thou hast not worn its cockade.</p>

<p>Yet, are we going past the Tub School, though
it lingers still in high places. We see it in party
squabbles, not so much of politics to-day, as of
the most esoteric doctrines of faith. We hear
great men discussing the question of "prevenient
grace," as they would discuss the composition
of milk punch, and we hear them mutually anathematize
each other on this plain and demonstrable
proposition. We call this Diogenism,
and of a virulent sort, too. We know that certain
men are tabooed by certain other men; that
a churchman refuses communion with him who
is of no church, or of a different church; and
that one Arian thinks dreadful things of another
Arian. We call these men Pharisees, who deny
kindred with the Samaritans&mdash;but we remember
who it was that befriended the Samaritans. We
know that monks still exist, whose duty to man
consists in endless prayers to <span class="smcap">God</span> (in using vain
repetitions as the Heathens do); who open their
mouths wide, and expect that Heaven will fill
them; who hold the active duties of life in no
esteem; and separate themselves from their fellows
in all the grandeur of religious superiority.
We can not see much difference between these
men, the Hindoo fakirs, and the unsavory gentlemen
of the Grecian tub. They are all of the
same genus; but, Heaven be praised! they are
dying out from the world of man, as leprosy, and
the black plague, and other evils are dying out.
True enlightenment will extirpate them, as well
as other malaria. If Sanitary Commissions sweep
out the cholera, acknowledged Love will sweep
out all this idleness and solitary hatred, and make
men at last confess that Love and Recognition
are grander things than contempt and intolerance;
in a word, that real Christianity is better
than any form whatsoever of the Diogenic philosophy
of hatred.</p>

<h2>GOLD&mdash;WHAT IT IS AND WHERE IT COMES FROM.</h2>


<p>Road-mending is pretty general at this
time of the year, and upon roads now being
newly macadamized we may pick up a good many
differing specimens of granite. On the newly-broken
surface of one of them, four substances
of which it is composed can be perceived with
great distinctness. The more earthy-looking
rock, in which the others seem to be embedded,
is called felspar; the little hard white stones are
bits of quartz; the dark specks are specks of
hornblende, and the shining scales are mica. Felspar,
quartz, hornblende, and mica are the four
constituents of granite. These are among the
rocks of the most ancient times, which form a
complete barrier to the power of the geologist in
turning back the pages which relate the story of
our globe. Layer under layer&mdash;leaf behind leaf&mdash;we
find printed the characters of life in all
past ages, till at last we come to rocks&mdash;greenstone,
porphyry, quartz, granite, and others&mdash;which
contain no trace of life; which do not
show, as rocks above them do, that they have
been deposited by water; but which have a crystalline
form, and set our minds to think of heat
and pressure. These lowest rocks are frequently
called "igneous," in contradistinction to the
stratified rocks nearer the surface, which have
been obviously deposited under water. Between
the two there is not an abrupt transition; for
above the igneous, and below the aqueous, are
rocks which belong to the set above them, insomuch
as they are stratified; while they belong
to the set below them&mdash;insomuch as they are
crystalline, contain no traces of life, and lead us
by their characters to think of heat and pressure.
These rocks, on account of their equivocal position,
are called metamorphic.</p>

<p>Under the influence of air, combined with that
of water&mdash;water potent in streams, lakes, and
seas, but not less potent as a vapor in our atmosphere,
when aided by alternations in the temperature&mdash;granite
decomposes. We noticed that
one of the constituents of granite&mdash;felspar&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
a comparatively earthy-looking mass, in which
the other matters seemed to be embedded. In
the decomposition of granite, this felspar is the
first thing to give way; it becomes friable, and
rains or rivers wash it down. Capital soil it
makes. When the constituents of granite part
in this way, quartz is the heaviest, and settles.
Felspar and the others may run with the stream,
more or less; quartz is not moved so easily.
Now, as our neighbors in America would put it,
"that's a fact;" and it concerns our gossip about
gold.</p>

<p>Below the oldest rocks there lie hidden the
sources of that volcanic action which is not yet
very correctly understood. Fortunately, we are
not now called upon for any explanation of it:
it is enough for us that such a force exists; and
thrusting below, forces granite and such rocks
(which ought to lie quite at the bottom), through
a rent made in the upper layers, and still up into
the air, until, in some places, they form the summit
of considerable mountains. Such changes
are not often, if ever, the results of a single,
mighty heave, which generates a great catastrophe
upon the surface of the earth; they are the
products of a force constantly applied through
ages in a given manner. In all geologic reasoning
we are apt to err grossly when we leave out
of our calculation the important element of time.
These lower rocks, then&mdash;these greenstones, porphyries
and granites, sienites and serpentines&mdash;thrust
themselves in many places through the
upper strata of the earth's crust, in such a way
as to form mountain ranges. Now, it is a fact,
that wherever the oldest of the aqueous deposits&mdash;such
as those called clay-slates, limestones,
and greywacke sandstones&mdash;happen to be superficial,
so as to be broken through by pressure
from below, and intruded upon by the igneous
rocks (especially if the said igneous rocks form
ranges tending at all from north to south), there
gold may be looked for. Gold, it is true, may be
found combined with much newer formations; but
it is under the peculiar circumstances just now
mentioned that gold may be expected to be found
in any great and valuable store.</p>

<p>In Australia, the gold discoveries, so new and
surprising to the public, are not new to the scientific
world. More than two years ago, in an
"Essay on the Distribution of Gold Ore," read
before the British Association, to which our
readers will be indebted for some of the facts
contained in the present gossip, Sir Roderick
Murchison "reminded his geological auditors
that, in considering the composition of the chief,
or eastern ridge of Australia, and its direction
from north to south, he had foretold (as well as
Colonel Helmersen, of the Russian Imperial
Mines) that gold would be found in it; and he
stated that, in the last year, one gentleman resident
in Sydney, who had read what he had written
and spoken on this point, had sent him specimens
of gold ore found in the Blue Mountains;
while, from another source, he had learnt that
the parallel north and south ridge in the Adelaide
region, which had yielded so much copper, had
also given undoubted signs of gold ore. The
operation of English laws, by which noble metals
lapse to the crown, had induced Sir Roderick
Murchison to represent to Her Majesty's Secretary
of State that no colonists would bestir themselves
in gold-mining, if some clear declaration
on the subject were not made; but, as no measures
on this head seemed to be in contemplation,
he inferred that the government may be of opinion,
that the discovery of any notable quantity of
gold might derange the stability and regular industry
of a great colony, which eventually must
depend upon its agricultural products." That
was the language used by Sir Roderick Murchison
in September, 1849; and in September, 1851,
we are all startled by the fact which brings emphatic
confirmation of his prophecy.</p>

<p>But it is not only about the Blue Mountains,
and in other districts, where the gold is now
sought, that the geologic conditions under which
gold may be sought reasonably are fulfilled. Take,
for example, the Ural Mountains. In very ancient
times the Scythian natives supplied gold from
thence; and gold was supplied also by European
tribes in Germany and elsewhere. Most of those
sources were worked out, or forgotten. Russia
for centuries possessed the Ural, and forgot its
gold. Many of us were boys when that was rediscovered.
The mountains had been worked for
their iron and copper by German miners, who
accidentally hit upon a vein of gold. The solid
vein was worked near Ekatrinburg&mdash;a process
expensive and, comparatively, unproductive, as
we shall presently explain. Then gold being
discovered accidentally in the superficial drift,
the more profitable work commenced. It is only
within the last very few years that Russia has
discovered gold in another portion of her soil,
among the spurs of the Altai Mountains, between
the Jena and the Lenisei, and along the shores
of Lake Baikal. This district has been enormously
productive, and, for about four years before
the discovery of gold in California, had been
adding largely to the gross amount of that metal
annually supplied for the uses of society. The
extent of this new district now worked is equal
to the whole area of France; but all the gold-bearing
land in Russia is not yet by any means
discovered. The whole area of country in Russia
which fulfills the conditions of a gold-bearing
district is immense. Eastward of the Ural Chain
it includes a large part of Siberia; and also in
Russian America there is nearly equal reason for
believing that hereafter gold will be discovered.</p>

<p>Before we quit Asia, we may observe, that the
Chinese produce gold out of their soil; and although
many of the mountain ranges in that
country tend from east to west, yet the conditions
of the surface, and the meridional directions of
the mountains too, would indicate in China some
extensive districts over which gold would probably
be found in tolerable abundance. Gold exists
also in Lydia and Hindostan.</p>

<p>Now to pass over to America, where, as we
have already said, the Russians have a district
in which gold may some day be discovered. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
many districts along the line of the Rocky Mountains,
especially in that part of them which is included
in the British territory, gold may be looked
for. The gold region of California has been
recently discovered. Gold in Mexico, where the
conditions are again fulfilled, is not a new discovery.
Gold in Central America lies neglected,
on account of the sad political condition of the
little states there. There is gold to be found,
perhaps, in the United States, some distance eastward
of the Rocky Mountains. Certainly gold
districts will be found about the Alleghanies.
Gold has been found in Georgia, North and South
Carolina, and Virginia; it exists also in Canada,
and may, probably, be found not very far north,
on the British side of the St. Lawrence. In the
frozen regions, which shut in those straits and
bays of the North Pole, to which early adventurers
were sent from England on the search for
gold, gold districts most probably exist, although
the shining matter was not gold which first excited
the cupidity of our forefathers. Passing
now to South America, New Granada, Peru,
Brazil, La Plata, Chili, even Patagonia, contain
districts which say, "Look for gold." There are
one or two districts in Africa where gold exists;
certainly in more districts than that which is
called the Gold Coast, between the Niger and
Cape Verd; also between Darfur and Abyssinia;
and on the Mozambique Coast, opposite Madagascar.
In Australia, the full extent of our gold
treasure is not yet discovered. In Europe, out
of Russia, Hungary supplies yearly one or two
hundred thousand pounds worth; there is gold
in Transylvania and Bohemia; the Rhine washes
gold down into its sands from the crystalline rocks
of the high Alps. The Danube, Rhone, and Tagus,
yield gold also in small quantities. There
are neglected mines of gold in Spain.</p>

<p>To come nearer home. In the mining fields
of Leadhills, in Scotland, gold was washed for
busily in the time of Queen Elizabeth. It is
found also in Glen Turret, in Perthshire, and at
Cumberhead, in Lanarkshire. Attempts have
been made to turn to account the gold existing
in North Wales and Cornwall. About sixty
years ago, gold was found accidentally in the bed
of streams which run from a mountain on the
confines of Wicklow and Wexford, by name,
Croghan Kinshela. A good deal of gold was collected
by the people, who, having the first pick,
had soon earned about ten thousand pounds
among them by their findings. Government then
established works, and having realized in two
years three thousand six hundred and seventy-five
pounds by the sale of gold, which it cost
them more than that amount to get, they let the
matter drop, judiciously.</p>

<p>Let nobody be dazzled, however, by this enumeration
of gold districts, which is not by any means
complete. It is quite true that there is no metal
diffused so widely over the world's surface as gold
is, with a single exception, that of iron. But
with regard to gold, there is this important fact
to be taken into account, that it is not often to be
obtained from veins, but is found sprinkled&mdash;in
many cases sprinkled very sparingly; it is found
mixed with quartz and broken rock, or sand and
alluvial deposit, often in quantities extremely
small, so that the time lost in its separation&mdash;even
though it be the time of slaves&mdash;is of more
value than the gold; and so the gold does not
repay the labor of extraction. It is only where a
gold district does not fall below a certain limit in
its richness, that it yields a profit to the laborer.
Pure gold in lumps, or grains, or flakes, is to be
found only at the surface. Where, as is here
and there the case, a vein of it is found deep in
connection with the quartz, it is combined with
other minerals, from which it can be separated
only by an expensive process; so that a gold
vein, when found, generally yields less profit
than a field. As for gold-hunting in general, the
history of every gold district unites to prove that
the trade is bad. It is a lottery in which, to be
sure, there are some prizes, but there is quite the
usual preponderance of blanks.</p>

<p>The villages of gold-seekers about Accra and
elsewhere, on the Gold Coast, are the villages of
negroes more squalid and wretched than free negroes
usually are. The wretchedness of gold-hunters
in the rich field of California is by this
time a hackneyed theme. Take, now, the picture
of a tolerably prosperous gold-seeker in
Brazil. He goes into the river with a leathern
jacket on, having a leathern bag fastened before
him. In his hand he carries a round bowl, of fig-tree
wood, about four or five feet in circumference,
and one foot deep. He goes into the river at
a part where it is not rapid, where it makes a
bend, and where it has deep holes. Be pleased to
remember that, and do not yet lose sight of what
was before said about the heaviness of quartz.
The gold-seeker, then, standing in the water,
scrapes away with his feet the large stones and
the upper layers of sand, and fishes up a bowlful
of the older gravel. This he shakes and washes,
and removes the upper layer; the gold being the
heaviest thing in the bowl, sinks, and when he
has got rid of all the other matter, which is after
a quarter of an hour's work, or more, he puts into
his pouch the residual treasure, which is worth
twopence farthing, on an average. He may earn
in this way about sevenpence an hour&mdash;not bad
wages, but, taken in connection with the nature
of the work, they do not look exceedingly attractive.
Here is a safe income, at any rate&mdash;no lottery.
A lump of gold, combined with quartz,
like that which has been dragged from California
by its lucky finder&mdash;a lump worth more than three
thousand pounds&mdash;is not a prize attainable in
river washing. That lump, its owner says, he got
out of a vein, which vein he comes to Europe to
seek aid in working. Veins of quartz containing
gold, when they occur, directly they cease to be
superficial, cease generally to be very profitable
to their owners. But of that we shall have to
say more presently.</p>

<p>By this time we have had occasion to observe
more than once that gold and quartz are very
friendly neighbors. Now, we will make use of
the fact which we have been saving up so long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
that when granite decomposes, quartz, the heaviest
material is least easily carried away, and
when carried away is first to be deposited by
currents. Gold also, is very heavy; in its lightest
compound, it is twelve times heavier than
water, and pure gold is nineteen times heavier;
gold, therefore, when stirred out of its place by
water, will soon settle to the bottom. Very often
gold will not be moved at all, nor even quartz; so
gold and quartz remain, while substances which
formerly existed in their neighborhood are washed
away. Or when the whole is swept away
together, after the gold has begun sinking, quartz
will soon be sinking too; and so, even in shingle
or alluvial deposits, gold and quartz are apt to occur
as exceedingly close neighbors to each other.</p>

<p>How the gold forms in those old rocks, we have
no right to say. Be it remembered, that in newer
formations it occurs, although more sparingly.
How the gold forms, we do not know. In fact,
we have no right to say of gold that it is formed
at all. In the present state of chemistry, gold is
considered as an element, a simple substance, of
which other things are formed, not being itself
compounded out of others. In the present state
of our knowledge, therefore&mdash;and the metals <i>may</i>
really be elements&mdash;we have nothing to trouble
ourselves about. Gold being one of the elements
(there are somewhere about forty in all) of which
the earth is built, of course existed from the beginning,
and will be found in the oldest rocks.
It exists, like other elements, in combination. It
is combined with iron, antimony, manganese,
copper, arsenic, and other things. But it is one
great peculiarity of gold that it is not easily oxydized
or rusted; rust being caused in metals by
the action of oxygen contained in our air. When,
therefore, gold, in a compound state, comes to be
superficial, the air acting on the mass will generally
oxydize the other metals, and so act upon
them, more especially where water helps, that in
the lapse of time this superficial gold will have
been purified in the laboratory of nature, and may
be finally picked up in the pure, or nearly pure,
state; or else it may be washed, equally pure,
from the superficial earth, as is now done in the
majority of gold districts. But deep below the
surface, in quartz veins contained within the
bowels of a mountain&mdash;though, to be sure, it is
not often found in such positions&mdash;gold exists
generally in a condition far from pure; the chemistry
of the artisan must do what the chemistry
of nature had effected in the other case; and this
involves rather an expensive process.</p>

<p>Surface gold is found, comparatively pure, in
lumps of very various sizes, or in rounded grains,
or in small scales. In this state it is found in
the Ural district, contained in a mass of coarse
gravel, like that found in the neighborhood of
London; elsewhere, it is contained in a rough
shingle, with much quartz; and elsewhere, in a
more mud-like alluvial deposit. The water that
has washed it out of its first bed has not been
always a mere mountain torrent, or a river, or a
succession of rains. Gold shingle and sand have
been accumulated in many districts, by the same
causes which produced our local drifts, in which
the bones of the mammoth, the rhinoceros, and
other extinct quadrupeds occur.</p>

<p>The nearly pure gold thus deposited in very
superficial layers, may be readily distinguished
from all other things that have external resemblance
to it. Gold in this state has always,
more or less, its well-known color, and the little
action of the air upon it causes its particles to
glitter, though they be distributed only in minute
scales through a bed of sand. But there are
other things that glitter. Scales of mica, to the
eye only, very much resemble gold. But gold is
extremely heavy; twelve or nineteen times heavier
than that same bulk of water; mica is very
light: sand itself being but three times heavier
than water. Let, therefore, sand, with glittering
scales in it, be shaken with water, and let us
watch the order of the settling. If the scales be
gold they will sink first, and quickly, to the bottom;
if they be mica, they will take their time,
and be among the last to sink. It is this property
of gold&mdash;its weight&mdash;which enables us to obtain
it by the process called gold-washing. Earth
containing gold, being agitated in water, the gold
falls to the bottom. Turbid water containing
gold, being poured over a skin, the gold falls and
becomes entangled in the hairs; or such water
being poured over a board with transverse grooves,
the gold is caught in the depressions. This is
the reason why the Brazilian searcher looks for
a depression in the bottom of the river, and this
is also the origin of those peculiar rich bits occasionally
found in the alluvium of a large gold-field.
Where there has been a hollow, as the
water passed it, gold continually was arrested
there, forming those valuable deposits which the
Brazilians call Caldeiraos. Sometimes, where the
waters have been arrested in the hollow of a
mountain, they have, in the same way, dropped
an excessive store of gold. This quality of weight,
therefore, is of prime importance in the history
of gold; it determined the character of its deposits
in the first instance; it enables us now to
extract it easily from its surrounding matter, and
enables us to detect it in a piece of rock, where
it may not be distinctly visible. There are two
substances which look exceedingly like gold;&mdash;copper
and iron pyrites, substances familiar to
most of us. We need never be puzzled to distinguish
them. Gold is a soft metal, softer than
iron, copper, and silver, although harder than tin
or lead. It will scratch tin or lead; but it will
be scratched with the other metals. That is to
say, you can scratch gold with a common knife.
Now, iron pyrites is harder than steel, and therefore
a knife will fail to scratch it. Gold and iron
pyrites, therefore, need never be mistaken for
each other by any man who has a piece of steel
about him. Copper pyrites can be scratched with
steel. But then there is another very familiar
property of gold, by which, in this case, it can
be distinguished. Gold is very malleable; beat
on it with a stone, and it will flatten, but not
break; and when it breaks, it shows that it is
torn asunder, by the thready, fibrous nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
its fracture. Beat with a stone on copper pyrites,
and it immediately begins to crumble. No
acid, by itself, can affect gold; but a mixture of
one part nitric, and four parts muriatic acid, is
called Aqua Regia, because in this mixture gold
does dissolve. A common test for gold, in commerce,
is to put nitric acid over it, which has no
action if the gold be true. There is, also, a hard
smooth stone, called Lydian stone, or flinty jasper,
by the mineralogists, and <i>touchstone</i> by the
jewelers, on which gold makes a certain mark;
and the character of the streak made on such a
stone will indicate pretty well the purity or value
of the gold that makes it.</p>

<p>We have said that when the gold occurs in a
deep-seated vein, combined with other minerals,
its extraction becomes no longer a simple process.
Let us now point out generally what the nature
of this process is, and then we shall conclude our
brief discussion; for what else we might say,
either lies beyond our present purpose, or has
been made, by the talking and writing of the last
two years, sufficiently familiar to all listeners or
readers. Mr. Gardner, superintendent of the
Royal Botanic Garden of Ceylon, thus describes
the process of extracting gold out of the mine of
Morro Velho. This mine, when St. Hilaire visited
it, was considered as exhausted; it is now
one of the richest in Brazil. Thus Mr. Gardner
writes of it:</p>

<p>"The ore is first removed from its bed by
blasting, and it is afterward broken, by female
slaves, into small pieces; after which it is conveyed
to the stamping-machine, to be reduced to
powder. A small stream of water, constantly
made to run through them, carries away the pulverized
matter to what is called the Strakes&mdash;a
wooden platform, slightly inclined, and divided
into a number of very shallow compartments, of
fourteen inches in width, the length being about
twenty-six feet. The floor of each of these compartments
is covered with pieces of tanned hide,
about three feet long, and sixteen inches wide,
which have the hair on. The particles of gold
are deposited among the hairs, while the earthy
matter, being lighter, is washed away. The
greater part of the gold dust is collected on the
three upper, or head skins, which are changed
every four hours, while the lower skins are
changed every six or eight hours, according to
the richness of the ore. The sand which is
washed from the head skins is collected together,
and amalgamated with quicksilver, in barrels;
while that from the lower skins is conveyed to
the washing-house, and concentrated over strakes
of similar construction to those of the stamping-mill,
till it be rich enough to be amalgamated
with that from the head-skins. The barrels into
which this rich sand is put, together with the
quicksilver, are turned by water; and the process
of amalgamation is generally completed in the
course of forty-eight hours. When taken out,
the amalgam is separated from the sand by washing.
It is then pressed on chamois skins, and
the quicksilver is separated from the gold by
sublimation."</p>

<p>Let us explain those latter processes in more
detail. If you dip a gold ring or a sovereign into
quicksilver, it will be silvered by it, and the silvering
will not come off. This union of theirs
is called an amalgam. On a ring or sovereign it
is mere silvering; but when the gold is in a state
of powder, and the amalgamation takes place on
a complete scale, it forms a white, doughy mass,
in which there is included much loose quicksilver.
This doughy mass is presently washed
clear of all impurities, and is then squeezed in
skins or cloths, through the pores of which loose
quicksilver is forced, and saved for future operations.
The rest of the quicksilver is burnt out.
Under a moderately strong heat, quicksilver evaporates,
or&mdash;to speak more scientifically&mdash;sublimes;
and gold does not. The amalgam, therefore,
being subjected to heat, the quicksilver
escapes by sublimation, leaving the gold pure.
The quicksilver escapes by sublimation; but its
owner does not wish it quite to escape out of his
premises, because it is an expensive article.
Chambers are therefore made over the ovens, in
which the mercury may once again condense,
and whence it may be collected again afterward.
But, with all precaution, a considerable waste
always takes place. Other processes are also in
use for the separation of gold from its various
alloys. We have described that which is of
most universal application. Let us not omit
noting the significance of the fact, that a quicksilver
mine exists in California.</p>

<h2>EYES MADE TO ORDER.</h2>


<p>Contradictory opinions prevail as to the
limits that should be assigned to the privilege
of calling Art to the aid of Nature. To
some persons a wig is the type of a false and
hollow age; an emblem of deceit; a device of
ingenious vanity, covering the wearer with gross
and unpardonable deceit. In like manner, a crusade
has been waged against the skill of the dentist&mdash;against
certain artificial "extents in aid"
of symmetry effected by the milliner.</p>

<p>The other side argues, in favor of the wig, that,
in the social intercourse of men, it is a laudable
object for any individual to propose to himself,
by making an agreeable appearance, to please,
rather than repel his associates. On the simple
ground that he would rather please than offend,
an individual, not having the proper complement
of hair and countenance, places a cunningly-fashioned
wig upon his head, artificial teeth in
his mouth, and an artificial nose upon his face.
A certain money-lender, it is urged, acknowledged
the elevating power of beauty when he
drew a vail before the portrait of his favorite
picture, that he might not see the semblance of
a noble countenance, while he extorted his crushing
interest from desperate customers. It is late
in the age, say the pro-wig party, to be called
upon to urge the refining power that dwells in
the beautiful; and, on the other hand, the depression
and the coarseness which often attend
the constant contemplation of things unsightly.
The consciousness of giving unpleasant sensations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to spectators, haunts all people who are
visibly disfigured. The bald man of five-and-twenty
is an unpleasant object; because premature
baldness is unnatural and ugly. Argue the
question according to the strictest rules of formal
logic, and you will arrive at nothing more than
that the thing is undoubtedly unpleasant to behold,
and that therefore some reason exists that
should urge men to remove it, or hide it. Undoubtedly,
a wig is a counterfeit of natural hair;
but is it not a counterfeit worn in deference to
the sense of the world, and with the view of presenting
an agreeable, instead of a disagreeable
object? Certainly. A pinch of philosophy is
therefore sprinkled about a wig, and the wearer
is not necessarily a coxcomb. As regards artificial
teeth, stronger pleas&mdash;even than those
which support wigs&mdash;may be entered. Digestion
demands that food should be masticated.
Shall, then, a toothless person be forced to live
upon spoon-meat, because artificial ivories are
denounced as sinful? These questions are fast
coming to issue, for Science has so far come to
the aid of human nature, that according to an
enthusiastic professor, it will be difficult, in the
course of another century, to tell how or where
any man or woman is deficient. A millennium
for Deformity is, it seems, not far distant. M.
Boissonneau of Paris, constructs eyes with such
extraordinary precision, that the artificial eye, we
are told, is not distinguishable from the natural
eye. The report of his pretensions will, it is to
be feared, spread consternation among those who
hold in abhorrence, and consider artificial teeth
incompatible with Christianity; yet the fact must
be honestly declared, that it is no longer safe for
poets to write sonnets about the eyes of their
mistresses, since those eyes may be M. Boissonneau's.</p>

<p>The old, rude, artificial eyes are simply oval
shells, all made from one pattern, and differing
only in size and in color. No pretension to artistic
or scientific skill has been claimed by the
artificial-eye manufacturer&mdash;he has made a certain
number of deep blues, light blues, hazels,
and others, according to the state of the eye-market.
These rude shells were constructed
mainly with the view of giving the wearer an
almond-shaped eye, and with little regard to its
matching the eye in sound and active service.
Artificial eyes were not made to order: but the
patient was left to pick out the eye he would
prefer to wear, as he would pick out a glove.
The manufacture was kept a profound mystery,
and few medical men had access to its secrets.
The manufacturers sold eyes by the gross, to
retail-dealers, at a low price; and these supplied
patients. Under this system, artificial eyes were
only applicable in the very rare cases of atrophy
of the globe; and the effect produced was even
more repulsive than that of the diseased eye.
The disease was hidden by an unnatural and repulsive
expression, which it is difficult to describe.
While one eye was gazing intently in your face,
the other was fixed in another direction&mdash;immovable,
the more hideous because at first you mistook
it for a natural eye. A smile may over
spread the face, animate the lip, and lighten up
the natural eye; but there was the glass eye&mdash;fixed,
lustreless, and dead. It had other disadvantages:
it interfered with the lachrymal functions,
and sometimes caused a tear to drop in the
happiest moments.</p>

<p>The new artificial eye is nothing more than a
plastic skullcap, set accurately upon the bulb of
the diseased eye, so that it moves with the bulb
as freely as the sound eye. The lids play freely
over it; the lachrymal functions continue their
healthy action; and the bulb is effectually protected
from currents of cold air and particles of
dust. But these effects can be gained only by
modeling each artificial eye upon the particular
bulb it is destined to cover; thus removing the
manufacture of artificial eyes from the hands of
clumsy mechanics, to the superintendence of the
scientific artist. Every individual case, according
to the condition of the bulb, requires an artificial
eye of a different model from all previously
made. In no two cases are the bulbs found in
precisely the same condition; and, therefore,
only the scientific workman, proceeding on well-grounded
principles, can pretend to practice ocular
prothesis with success. The newly-invented
shell is of metallic enamel, which may be fitted
like an outer cuticle to the bulb&mdash;the cornea of
which is destroyed&mdash;and restores to the patient
his natural appearance. The invention, however,
will, we fear, increase our skepticism. We
shall begin to look in people's eyes, as we have
been accustomed to examine a luxuriant head of
hair, when it suddenly shoots upon a surface
hitherto remarkable only for a very straggling
crop. Yet, it would be well to abate the spirit
of sarcasm with which wigs and artificial teeth
have been treated. Undoubtedly, it is more
pleasant to owe one's hair to nature than to
Truefit; to be indebted to natural causes for
pearly teeth; and to have sparkling eyes with
light in them. Every man and woman would
rather have an aquiline nose than the most playful
pug; no one would exchange eyes agreeing
to turn in one direction, for the pertest squint;
or legs observing something approaching to a
straight line, for undecided legs, with contradictory
bends. Hence dumb-bells, shoulder-boards,
gymnastic exercises, the consumption of sugar
steeped in Eau-de-Cologne (a French recipe for
imparting brightness to the eyes), ingenious padding,
kalydors, odontos, Columbian balms, bandolines,
and a thousand other ingenious devices.
Devices with an object, surely&mdash;that object, the
production of a pleasing <i>personnel</i>. It is a wise
policy to remove from sight the calamities which
horrify or sadden; and, as far as possible, to cultivate
all that pleases from its beauty or its grace.
Therefore, let us shake our friend with the cork-leg
by the hand, and, acknowledging that the
imitation is worn in deference to our senses, receive
it as a veritable flesh-and-blood limb; let
us accept the wig of our unfortunate young companion,
as the hair which he has lost; let us shut
our eyes to the gold work that fastens the brilliantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
white teeth of a young lady, whose natural
dentition has been replaced; and, above all, let
us never show, by sign or word, that the appearance
of our friend (who has suffered tortures,
and lost the sight of one eye) is changed after
the treatment invented by M. Boissonneau.</p>

<h2>THE EXPECTANT.&mdash;A TALE OF LIFE.</h2>


<p>When a boy I was sent to school in a country
village in one of the midland counties.
Midvale lay on a gentle slope at the foot of a
lofty hill, round which the turnpike-road wound
scientifically to diminish the steepness of the
declivity; and the London coach, as it smoked
along the white road regularly at half-past four
o'clock, with one wheel dragged, might be tracked
for two good miles before it crossed the bridge
over the brook below and disappeared from sight.
We generally rushed out of the afternoon school
as the twanging horn of the guard woke up our
quiet one street; and a fortunate fellow I always
thought was Griffith Maclean, our only day-boarder,
who on such occasions would often
chase the flying mail, and seizing the hand of
the guard, an old servant of his uncle's, mount
on the roof, and ride as far as he chose for the
mere trouble of walking back again. Our school
consisted of between twenty and thirty boys,
under the care of a master who knew little and
taught still less; for having three sermons to
preach every Sunday, besides two on week-days,
he had but little leisure to spare for the duties of
the school; and the only usher he could afford
to keep was a needy, hard-working lad, whose
poverty and time-worn habiliments deprived him
of any moral control over the boys. This state
of things, coupled with the nervous and irascible
temper of the pedagogue, naturally produced a
good deal of delinquency, which was duly scored
off on the backs of the offenders every morning
before breakfast. Thus what we wanted in tuition
was made up in flogging; and if the master
was rarely in the school, he made amends for
his absence by a vigorous use of his prerogative
while he was there. Griffith Maclean, who was
never present on these occasions, coming only
at nine o'clock, was yet our common benefactor.
One by one he had taken all our jackets to a
cobbling tailor in the village, and got them for a
trifling cost so well lined with old remnants of a
kind of felt or serge, for the manufacture of which
the place was famous, that we could afford to
stand up without wincing, and even to laugh
through our wry faces under the matutinal ceremony
of caning. Further, Griffith was the sole
means of communication with the shopkeepers,
and bought our cakes, fruit, and playthings,
when we had money to spend, and would generally
contrive to convey a hunch of bread and
cheese from home, to any starving victim who
was condemned to fasting for his transgressions.
In return for all this sympathy we could do no
less than relieve Griffith, as far as possible, from
the trouble and 'bother,' as he called it, of study.
We worked his sums regularly for days beforehand,
translated his Latin, and read over his lessons
with our fingers as he stood up to repeat
them before the master.</p>

<p>Griffith's mother was the daughter of a gentleman
residing in the neighborhood of Midvale.
Fifteen years ago she had eloped with a young
Irish officer&mdash;an unprincipled fortune-hunter&mdash;who,
finding himself mistaken in his venture, the
offended father having refused any portion, had
at first neglected and finally deserted his wife,
who had returned home with Griffith, her only
child, to seek a reconciliation with her parents.
This had never been cordially granted. The old
man had other children who had not disobeyed
him, and to them, at his death, he bequeathed
the bulk of his property, allotting to Griffith's
mother only a life-interest in a small estate which
brought her something less than a hundred pounds
a year. But the family were wealthy, and the
fond mother hoped, indeed fully expected, that
they would make a gentlemanly provision for
her only child. In this expectation Griffith was
nurtured and bred; and being reminded every
day that he was born a gentleman, grew up with
the notion that application and labor of any sort
were unbecoming the character he would have
to sustain. He was a boy of average natural
abilities, and with industry might have cultivated
them to advantage: but industry was a plebeian
virtue, which his silly mother altogether discountenanced,
and withstood the attempts, not
very vigorous, of the schoolmaster to enforce.
Thus he was never punished, seldom reproved;
and the fact that he was the sole individual so
privileged in a school where both reproof and
punishment were so plentiful, could not fail of
impressing him with a great idea of his own importance.
Schoolboys are fond of speculating
on their future prospects, and of dilating on the
fancied pleasures of manhood and independence,
and the delights of some particular trade or profession
upon which they have set their hearts;
the farm, the forge, the loom, the counter, the
press, the desk, have as eager partisans among
the knucklers at <i>taw</i> as among older children;
and while crouching round the dim spark of fire
on a wet winter day, we were wont to chalk out
for ourselves a future course of life when released
from the drudgery, as we thought it, of school.
Some declared for building, carpentering, farming,
milling, or cattle-breeding; some were panting
for life in the great city; some longed for
the sea and travel to foreign countries; and some
for a quiet life at home amid rural sports and the
old family faces. Above all, Griffith Maclean
towered in unapproachable greatness. "I shall
be a gentleman," said he; "if I don't have a
commission in the army&mdash;which I am not sure I
should like, because it's a bore to be ordered off
where you don't want to go&mdash;I shall have an
official situation under government, with next to
nothing to do but to see life and enjoy myself."
Poor Griffith!</p>

<p>Time wore on. One fine morning I was packed,
along with a couple of boxes, on the top of
the London coach; and before forty-eight hours
had elapsed, found myself bound apprentice to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
hard-working master and a laborious profession
in the heart of London. Seven years I served
and wrought in acquiring the art and mystery,
as my indentures termed it, of my trade. Seven
times in the course of this period it was my pleasant
privilege to visit Midvale, where some of
my relations dwelt, and at each visit I renewed
the intimacy with my old school-fellow, Griffith.
He was qualifying himself for the life of a gentleman
by leading one of idleness; and I envied
him not a little his proficiency in the use of the
angle and the gun, and the opportunity he occasionally
enjoyed of following the hounds upon a
borrowed horse. At my last visit, at the end of
my term of apprenticeship, I felt rather hurt at
the cold reception his mother gave me, and at
the very haughty, off-hand bearing of Griffith
himself; and I resolved to be as independent as
he by giving him an opportunity of dropping the
acquaintance if he chose. I understood, however,
that both he and his mother were still feeding
upon expectation, and that they hoped every
thing from General &mdash;&mdash;, to whom application
had been made on Griffith's behalf, as the son
of an officer, and that they confidently expected
a cadetship that would open up the road to promotion
and fortune. The wished-for appointment
did not arrive. Poor Griffith's father had
died without leaving that reputation behind him
which might have paved the way for his son's
advancement, and the application was not complied
with. This was a mortifying blow to the
mother, whose pride it painfully crushed. Griffith,
now of age, proposed that they should remove
to London, where, living in the very source
and centre of official appointments, they might
bring their influence to bear upon any suitable
berth that might be vacant. They accordingly
left Midvale and came to town, where they lived
in complete retirement upon a very limited income.
I met Griffith accidentally after he had
been in London about a year. He shook me
heartily by the hand, was in high spirits, and informed
me that he had at length secured the promise
of an appointment to a situation in S&mdash;&mdash;
House, in case T&mdash;&mdash;, the sitting member, should
be again returned for the county. His mother
had three tenants, each with a vote, at her command;
and he was going down to Midvale, as
the election was shortly coming off, and would
bag a hundred votes, at least, he felt sure, before
polling-day. I could not help thinking as he
rattled away, that this was just the one thing he
was fit for. With much of the air, gait, and manners
of a gentleman, he combined a perfection
in the details of fiddle-faddle and small talk rarely
to be met with; and from having no independent
opinion of his own upon any subject whatever,
was so much the better qualified to secure
the voices of those who had. He went down to
Midvale, canvassed the whole district with astonishing
success, and had the honor of dining
with his patron, the triumphant candidate, at the
conclusion of the poll. On his return to town,
in the overflowings of his joy, he wrote a note to
me expressive of his improved prospects, and
glorying in the certainty of at length obtaining
an official appointment. I was very glad to hear
the good news, but still more surprised at the
terms in which it was conveyed; the little that
Griffith had learned at school he had almost
contrived to lose altogether in the eight or nine
years that had elapsed since he had left it. He
seemed to ignore the very existence of such contrivances
as syntax and orthography; and I really
had grave doubts as to whether he was competent
to undertake even an official situation in
S&mdash;&mdash; House.</p>

<p>These doubts were not immediately resolved.
Members of parliament, secure in their seats, are
not precisely so anxious to perform as they sometimes
are ready to promise when their seats seem
sliding from under them. It was very nearly
two years before Griffith received any fruit from
his electioneering labors, during which time he
had been leading a life of lounging, do-nothing,
dreamy semi-consciousness, occasionally varied
by a suddenly-conceived and indignant remonstrance,
hurled in foolscap at the head of the defalcating
member for the county. During all this
time fortune used him but scurvily: his mother's
tenants at Midvale clamored for a reduction of
rent; one decamped without payment of arrears;
repairs were necessary, and had to be done and
paid for. These drawbacks reduced the small
income upon which they lived, and sensibly affected
the outward man of the gentlemanly Griffith:
he began to look seedy, and occasionally
borrowed a few shillings of me when we casually
met, which he forgot to pay. I must do him the
credit to say that he never avoided me on account
of these trifling debts, but with an innate frankness
characteristic of his boyhood, continued his
friendship and his confidences. At length the
happy day arrived. He received his appointment,
bearing the remuneration of &pound;200 a year, which
he devoutly believed was to lead to something
infinitely greater, and called on me on his way
to the office where he was to be installed and indoctrinated
into his function.</p>

<p>The grand object of her life&mdash;the settlement
of her son&mdash;thus accomplished, the mother returned
to Midvale, where she shortly after died,
in the full conviction that Griffith was on the
road to preferment and fortune. The little estate&mdash;upon
the proceeds of which she had frugally
maintained herself and son&mdash;passed, at her death,
into the hands of one of her brothers, none of whom
took any further notice of Griffith, who had mortally
offended them by his instrumentality in returning
the old member for the county, whom it
was their endeavor to unseat. There is a mystery
connected with Griffith's tenure of office which
I could never succeed in fathoming. He held it
but for six months, when, probably not being
competent to keep it, he sold it to an advertising
applicant, who offered a douceur of &pound;300 for
such a berth. How the transfer was arranged I
can not tell, not knowing the recondite formula
in use upon these occasions. Suffice it to say
that Griffith had his &pound;300, paid his little debts,
renewed his wardrobe and his expectations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
began to cast about for a new patron. He was
now a gentleman about town, and exceedingly
well he both looked and acted the character: he
had prudence enough to do it upon an economical
scale, and though living upon his capital, doled
it out with a sparing hand. As long as his
money lasted he did very well; but before the
end of the third year the bloom of his gentility
had worn off, and it was plain that he was painfully
economizing the remnant of his funds.</p>

<p>About this time I happened to remove to a different
quarter of the metropolis, and lost sight of
him for more than a year. One morning, expecting
a letter of some importance, I waited for the
postman before walking to business. What was
my astonishment on responding personally to his
convulsive "b'bang," to recognize under the gold-banded
hat and red-collared coat of that peripatetic
official the gentlemanly figure and features
of my old schoolfellow Griffith Maclean!</p>

<p>"What! Griff?" I exclaimed: "is it possible?&mdash;can
this be you?"</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I am inclined to think it is.
You see, old fellow, a man must do something or
starve. This is all I could get out of that shabby
fellow T&mdash;&mdash; and I should not have got this had
I not well worried him. He knows I have no
longer a vote for the county. However, I shan't
wear this livery long: there are good berths
enough in the post-office. If they don't pretty
soon give me something fit for a gentleman to do,
I shall take myself off as soon as any thing better
offers. But, by George? there is not much time
allowed for talking: I must be off&mdash;farewell!"</p>

<p>Soon after this meeting the fourpenny deliveries
commenced; and these were before long
followed by the establishment of the universal
Penny-post. This was too much for Griffith.
He swore he was walked off his legs; that people
did nothing upon earth but write letters;
that he was jaded to death by lugging them
about; that he had no intention of walking into
his coffin for the charge of one penny; and,
finally, that he would have no more of it. Accordingly
he made application for promotion on
the strength of his recommendation, was refused
as a matter of course, and vacated his post for
the pleasure of a week's rest, which he declared
was more than it was honestly worth.</p>

<p>By this time destiny had made me a housekeeper
in "merry Islington;" and poor Griff,
now reduced to his shifts, waited on me one
morning with a document to which he wanted my
signature, the object of which was to get him
into the police force. Though doubting his perseverance
in any thing, I could not but comply
with his desire, especially as many of my neighbors
had done the same. The paper testified only
as to character; and as Griff was sobriety itself,
and as it would have required considerable ingenuity
to fasten any vice upon him, I might have
been hardly justified in refusing. I represented
to him as I wrote my name, that should he be
successful, he would really have an opportunity
of rising by perseverance in good conduct to an
upper grade. "Of course," said he, "that is
my object; it would never do for a gentleman to
sit down contented as a policeman. I intend to
rise from the ranks, and I trust you will live to
see me one day at the head of the force."</p>

<p>He succeeded in his application; and not long
after signing his paper I saw him indued with
the long coat, oil-cape, and glazed hat of the
brotherhood, marching off in Indian file for night-duty
to his beat in the H&mdash;&mdash; Road. Whether
the night air disagreed with his stomach, or
whether his previous duty as a postman had
made him doubly drowsy, I can not say, but he
was found by the inspector on going his rounds
in a position too near the horizontal for the regulations
of the force, and suspended, after repeated
trangression, for sleeping upon a bench
under a covered doorway while a robbery was
going on in the neighborhood. He soon found
that the profession was not at all adapted to his
habits, and had not power enough over them to
subdue them to his vocation. He lingered on for
a few weeks under the suspicious eye of authority,
and at length took the advice of the inspector,
and withdrew from the force.</p>

<p>He did not make his appearance before me as
I expected, and I lost sight of him for a long
while. What new shifts and contrivances he
had recourse to&mdash;what various phases of poverty
and deprivation he became acquainted with during
the two years that he was absent from my sight,
are secrets which no man can fathom. I was
standing at the foot of Blackfriar's Bridge one
morning waiting for a clear passage to cross the
road, and began mechanically reading a printed
board, offering to all the sons of Adam&mdash;whom,
for the especial profit of the slopsellers, Heaven
sends naked into the world&mdash;garments of the
choicest broadcloth for next to nothing, and had
just mastered the whole of the large-printed lie,
when my eye fell full upon the bearer of the
board, whose haggard but still gentlemanly face
revealed to me the lineaments of my old friend
Griff. He laughed in spite of his rags as our
eyes met, and seized my proffered hand.</p>

<p>"And what," said I, not daring to be silent,
"do they pay you for this?"</p>

<p>"Six shillings a week," said Griff, "and that's
better than nothing."</p>

<p>"Six shillings and your board of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this board" (tapping the placarded
timber); "and a confounded heavy board it is.
Sometimes when the wind takes it, though, I'm
thinking it will fly away with me into the river,
heavy as it is."</p>

<p>"And do you stand here all day?"</p>

<p>"No, not when it rains: the wet spoils the
print, and we have orders to run under cover.
After one o'clock I walk about with it wherever
I like, and stretch my legs a bit. There's no
great hardship in it if the pay was better."</p>

<p>I left my old playmate better resigned to his
lowly lot than I thought to have found him. It
was clear that he had at length found a function
for which he was at least qualified; that he knew
the fact; and that the knowledge imparted some
small spice of satisfaction to his mind. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
happy to have to state that this was the deepest
depth to which he has fallen. He has never
been a <i>sandwich</i>&mdash;I am sure indeed he would
never have borne it. With his heavy board
mounted on a stout staff, he could imagine himself,
as no doubt he often did, a standard-bearer
on the battle-field, determined to defend his colors
with his last breath; and his tall, gentlemanly,
and somewhat officer-like figure, might well suggest
the comparison to a casual spectator. But
to encase his genteel proportions in a surtout of
papered planks, or hang a huge wooden extinguisher
over his shoulders labeled with colored
stripes&mdash;it would never have done: it would have
blotted out the gentleman, and therefore have
worn away the heart of one whose shapely gentility
was all that was left to him.</p>

<p>One might have thought, after all the vicissitudes
he had passed through, that the soul of
Griffith Maclean was dead to the voice of ambition.
Not so, however. On the first establishment
of the street-orderlies, that chord in his
nature spontaneously vibrated once again. If he
could only get an appointment it would be a rise
in the social scale&mdash;leading by degrees&mdash;who can
tell?&mdash;to the resumption of his original status, or
even something beyond.... I hear a gentle
knock, a modest, low-toned single dab, at the
street-door as I am sitting down to supper on my
return home after the fatigues of business. Betty
is in no hurry to go to the door, as she is poaching
a couple of eggs, and prides herself upon
performing that delicate operation in irreproachable
style. "Squilsh!" they go one after another
into the saucepan&mdash;I hear it as plainly as
though I were in the kitchen. Now the plates
clatter; the tray is loading; and now the eggs
are walking up stairs, steaming under Betty's
face, when "dab" again&mdash;a thought, only a
thought louder than before&mdash;at the street-door.
The spirit of patience is outside; and now Betty
runs with an apology for keeping him waiting.
"Here's a man wants to speak to master; says
he'll wait if you are engaged, sir; he ain't in no
hurry." "Show him in;" and in walks Griff,
again armed with a document&mdash;a petition for
employment as a street-orderly, with testimonials
of good character, honesty, and all that. Of
course I again append my signature, without any
allusion to the police force. I wish him all success,
and have a long talk over past fun and
follies, and present hopes and future prospects,
and the philosophy of poverty and the deceitfulness
of wealth. We part at midnight, and Griff
next day gets the desiderated appointment.</p>

<p>It is raining hard while I write, and by the
same token I know that at this precise moment
Griffith in his glazed hat, and short blouse, and
ponderous mud-shoes, is clearing a channel for
the diluted muck of C&mdash;&mdash; street, city, and directing
the black, oozy current by the shortest
cut to the open grating connected with the common
sewer. I am as sure as though I were
superintending the operation, that he handles his
peculiar instrument&mdash;a sort of hybrid between a
hoe and a rake&mdash;with the grace and air of a
gentleman&mdash;a grace and an air proclaiming to
the world that though <i>in</i> the profession, whatever
it may be called, which he has assumed, he
is not <i>of</i> it, and vindicating the workmanship of
nature, who, whatever circumstances may have
compelled him to become, cast him in the mould
of a gentleman. It is said that in London every
man finds his level. Whether Griffith Maclean,
after all his vicissitudes, has found his, I do not
pretend to say. Happily for him, he thinks that
fortune has done her worst, and that he is bound
to rise on her revolving wheel as high at least as
he has fallen low. May the hope stick by him,
and give birth to energies productive of its realization!</p>

<h2>THE PLEASURES AND PERILS OF BALLOONING.</h2>


<p>It would appear that, in almost every age, from
time immemorial, there has been a strong feeling
in certain ambitious mortals to ascend among
the clouds. They have felt with Hecate&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh what a dainty pleasure 'tis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sail in the air!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So many, besides those who have actually indulged
in it, have felt desirous of tasting the
"dainty pleasure" of a perilous flight, that we
are compelled to believe that the attraction is not
only much greater than the inducement held out
would leave one to expect, but that it is far more
extensive than generally supposed. Eccentric
ambition, daring, vanity, and the love of excitement
and novelty, have been quite as strong impulses
as the love of science, and of making new
discoveries in man's mastery over physical nature.
Nevertheless, the latter feeling has, no doubt,
been the main-stay, if not the forerunner and father
of these attempts, and has held it in public
respect, notwithstanding the many follies that have
been committed.</p>

<p>To master the physical elements, has always
been the great aim of man. He commenced with
earth, his own natural, obvious, and immediate
element, and he has succeeded to a prodigious
extent, being able to do (so far as he knows)
almost whatever he wills with the surface; and,
though reminded every now and then by some
terrible disaster that he is getting "out of bounds"
has effected great conquests amidst the dark depths
beneath the surface. Water and fire came next
in requisition; and by the process of ages, man
may fairly congratulate himself on the extraordinary
extent, both in kind and degree, to which
he has subjected them to his designs&mdash;designs
which have become complicated and stupendous
in the means by which they are carried out, and
having commensurate results both of abstract
knowledge and practical utility. But the element
of air has hitherto been too subtle for all his projects,
and defied his attempts at conquest. That
element which permeates all earthly bodies, and
without breathing which the animal machine can
not continue its vital functions&mdash;into that grand
natural reservoir of breath, there is every physical
indication that it is not intended man should
ascend as its lord. Traveling and voyaging man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
must be content with earth and ocean;&mdash;the sublime
highways of air, are, to all appearance, denied
to his wanderings.</p>

<p>Wild and daring as was the act, it is no less
true that men's first attempts at a flight through
the air were literally with wings. They conjectured
that by elongating their arms with a broad
mechanical covering, they could convert them into
wings; and forgetting that birds possess air-cells,
which they can inflate, that their bones are full of
air instead of marrow, and, also, that they possess
enormous strength of sinews expressly for
this purpose, these desperate half-theorists have
launched themselves from towers and other high
places, and floundered down to the demolition of
their necks, or limbs, according to the obvious
laws and penalties of nature. We do not allude
to the Icarus of old, or any fabulous or remote
aspirants, but to modern times. Wonderful as
it may seem, there are some instances in which
they escaped with only a few broken bones.
Milton tells a story of this kind in his "History
of Britain;" the flying man being a monk of
Malmsbury, "in his youth." He lived to be impudent
and jocose on the subject, and attributed
his failure entirely to his having forgotten to wear
a broad tail of feathers. In 1742 the Marquis de
Bacqueville announced that he would fly with
wings from the top of his own house on the <i>Quai
des Theatins</i> to the garden of the <i>Tuileries</i>. He
actually accomplished half the distance, when,
being exhausted with his efforts, the wings no
longer beat the air, and he came down into the
Seine, and would have escaped unhurt, but that
he fell against one of the floating machines of
the Parisian laundresses, and thereby fractured
his leg. But the most successful of all these instances
of the extraordinary, however misapplied,
force of human energies and daring, was that of
a certain citizen of Bologna, in the thirteenth
century, who actually managed, with some kind
of wing contrivance, to fly from the mountain
of Bologna to the River Reno, without injury.
"Wonderful! admirable!" cried all the citizens
of Bologna. "Stop a little!" said the officers of
the Holy Inquisition; "this must be looked into."
They sat in sacred conclave. If the man had
been killed, said they, or even mutilated shockingly,
our religious scruples would have been
satisfied; but, as he has escaped unhurt, it is clear
that he must be in league with the devil. The
poor "successful" man was therefore condemned
to be burnt alive; and the sentence of the Holy
Catholic Church was carried into Christian execution.</p>

<p>That flying, however, could be effected by the
assistance of some more elaborate sort of machinery,
or with the aid of chemistry, was believed at
an early period. Friar Bacon suggested it; so
did Bishop Wilkins, and the Marquis of Worcester;
it was likewise projected by Fleyder, by the
Jesuit Lana, and many other speculative men of
ability. So far, however, as we can see, the first
real discoverer of the balloon was Dr. Black, who,
in 1767, proposed to inflate a large skin with
hydrogen gas; and the first who brought theory
into practice were the brothers Montgolfier. But
their theory was that of the "fire-balloon," or the
formation of an artificial cloud, of smoke, by means
of heat from a lighted brazier placed beneath an
enormous bag, or balloon, and fed with fuel while
up in the air. The Academy of Sciences immediately
gave the invention every encouragement,
and two gentlemen volunteered to risk an ascent
in this alarming machine.</p>

<p>The first of these was Pil&acirc;tre de Rosier, a gentleman
of scientific attainments, who was to conduct
the machine, and he was accompanied by
the Marquis d'Arlandes, an officer in the Guards.
They ascended in the presence of the Court of
France, and all the scientific men in Paris. They
had several narrow escapes of the whole machine
taking fire, but eventually returned to the ground
in safety. Both these courageous men came to
untimely ends subsequently. Pil&acirc;tre de Rosier,
admiring the success of the balloon afterward
made by Professor Charles, and others, (<i>viz.</i>, a
balloon filled with hydrogen gas), conceived the
idea of uniting the two systems, and accordingly
ascended with a large balloon of that kind,
having a small fire-balloon beneath it&mdash;the upper
one to sustain the greater portion of the weight,
the lower one to enable him to alter his specific
gravity as occasion might require, and thus to
avoid the usual expenditure of gas and ballast.
Right in theory&mdash;but he had forgotten one thing.
Ascending too high, confident in his theory, the
upper balloon became distended too much, and
poured down a stream of hydrogen gas, in self-relief,
which reached the little furnace of the fire-balloon,
and the whole machine became presently
one mass of flame. It was consumed in the
air, as it descended, and with it of course, the
unfortunate Pil&acirc;tre de Rosier. The untimely
fate of the Marquis d'Arlandes, his companion in
the first ascent ever made in a balloon, was hastened
by one of those circumstances which display
the curious anomalies in human nature;&mdash;he was
broken for cowardice in the execution of his military
duties, and is supposed to have committed
suicide.</p>

<p>If we consider the shape, structure, appurtenances,
and capabilities of a ship of early ages,
and one of the present time, we must be struck
with admiration at the great improvement that
has been made, and the advantages that have
been obtained; but balloons are very nearly what
they were from the first, and are as much at
the mercy of the wind for the direction they will
take. Neither is there at present any certain
prospect of an alteration in this condition. Their
so-called "voyage" is little more than "drifting,"
and can be no more, except by certain man&#339;uvres
which obtain precarious exceptions, such as rising
to take the chance of different currents, or lowering
a long and weighty rope upon the earth
(an ingenious invention of Mr. Green's, called
the "guide rope"), to be trailed along the ground.
If, however, man is ever to be a flying animal,
and to travel in the air whither he listeth, it must
be by other means than wings, balloons, paddle-machines,
and aerial ships&mdash;several of which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
now building in America, in Paris, and in London.
We do not doubt the mechanical genius of inventors&mdash;but
the motive power. We will offer a few
remarks on these projects before we conclude.</p>

<p>But let us, at all events, ascend into the sky!
Taking balloons as they are, "for better, for
worse," as Mr. Green would say&mdash;let us for once
have a flight in the air.</p>

<p>The first thing you naturally expect is some
extraordinary sensation in springing high up into
the air, which takes away your breath for a time.
But no such matter occurs. The extraordinary
thing is, that you experience no sensation at all,
so far as motion is concerned. So true is this,
that on one occasion, when Mr. Green wished to
rise a little above a dense crowd, in order to get
out of the extreme heat and pressure that surrounded
his balloon, those who held the ropes,
misunderstanding his direction, let go entirely,
and the balloon instantly rose, while the aeronaut
remained calmly seated, wiping his forehead with
a handkerchief, after the exertions he had undergone
in preparing for the flight, and totally unconscious
of what had happened. He declares
that he only became aware of the circumstance,
when, on reaching a considerable elevation (a
few seconds are often quite enough for that), he
heard the shouts of the multitude becoming fainter
and fainter, which caused him to start up, and
look over the edge of the car.</p>

<p>A similar unconsciousness of the time of their
departure from earth has often happened to "passengers."
A very amusing illustration of this is
given in a letter published by Mr. Poole, the well-known
author, shortly after his ascent. "I do
not despise you," says he, "for talking about a
balloon going up, for it is an error which you
share in common with some millions of our fellow-creatures;
and I, in the days of my ignorance,
thought with the rest of you. I know better now.
The fact is, we do not <i>go up</i> at all; but at about
five minutes past six on the evening of Friday,
the 14th of September, 1838&mdash;at about that time,
Vauxhall Gardens, with all the people in them,
<i>went down</i>!" What follows is excellent. "I
can not have been deceived," says he; "I speak
from the evidence of my senses, founded upon
repetition of the fact. Upon each of the three or
four experimental trials of the powers of the balloon
to enable the people to glide away from us
with safety to themselves&mdash;down they all went
about thirty feet?&mdash;then, up they came again,
and so on. There we sat quietly all the while,
in our wicker buck-basket, utterly unconscious
of motion; till, at length, Mr. Green snapping a
little iron, and thus letting loose the rope by which
<i>the earth was suspended to us</i>&mdash;like Atropos, cutting
the connection between us with a pair of
shears&mdash;down it went, with every thing on it;
and your poor, paltry, little Dutch toy of a town,
(your Great Metropolis, as you insolently call it),
having been placed on casters for the occasion&mdash;I
am satisfied of <i>that</i>&mdash;was gently rolled away
from under us."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Feeling nothing of the ascending motion, the
first impression that takes possession of you in
"going up" in a balloon, is the quietude&mdash;the
silence, that grows more and more entire. The
restless heaving to and fro of the huge inflated
sphere above your head (to say nothing of the
noise of the crowd), the flapping of ropes, the
rustling of silk, and the creaking of the basketwork
of the car&mdash;all has ceased. There is a
total cessation of all atmospheric resistance. You
sit in a silence which becomes more perfect every
second. After the bustle of many moving objects,
you stare before you into blank air. We make
no observations on other sensations&mdash;to wit, the
very natural one of a certain increased pulse, at
being so high up, with a chance of coming down
so suddenly, if any little matter went wrong. As
all this will differ with different individuals, according
to their nervous systems and imaginations,
we will leave each person to his own impressions.</p>

<p>So much for what you first feel; and now what
is the first thing you do? In this case every
body is alike. We all do the same thing. We
look over the side of the car. We do this very
cautiously&mdash;keeping a firm seat, as though we
clung to our seat by a certain attraction of cohesion&mdash;and
then, holding on by the edge, we
carefully protrude the peak of our traveling-cap,
and then the tip of the nose, over the edge of
the car, upon which we rest our mouth. Every
thing below is seen in so new a form, so flat,
compressed and simultaneously&mdash;so much too-much-at-a-time&mdash;that
the first look is hardly so
satisfactory as could be desired. But soon we
thrust the chin fairly over the edge, and take a
good stare downward; and this repays us much
better. Objects appear under very novel circumstances
from this vertical position, and ascending
retreat from them (though it is <i>they</i> that appear
to sink and retreat from us). They are stunted
and foreshortened, and rapidly flattened to a map-like
appearance; they get smaller and smaller,
and clearer and clearer. "An idea," says Monck
Mason, "involuntarily seizes upon the mind, that
the earth with all its inhabitants had, by some
unaccountable effort of nature, been suddenly
precipitated from its hold, and was in the act of
slipping away from beneath the aeronaut's feet
into the murky recesses of some unfathomable
abyss below. Every thing, in fact, but himself,
seems to have been suddenly endowed with motion."
Away goes the earth, with all its objects&mdash;sinking
lower and lower, and every thing becoming
less and less, but getting more and more
distinct and defined as they diminish in size.
But, besides the retreat toward minuteness, the
phantasmagoria flattens as it lessens&mdash;men and
women are of five inches high, then of four, three,
two, one inch&mdash;and now a speck; the Great
Western is a narrow strip of parchment, and
upon it you see a number of little trunks "running
away with each other," while the Great
Metropolis itself is a board set out with toys; its
public edifices turned into "baby-houses, and
pepper-casters, and extinguishers, and chess-men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
with here and there a dish-cover&mdash;things which
are called domes, and spires, and steeples!" As
for the Father of Rivers, he becomes a dusky-gray,
winding streamlet, and his largest ships are
no more than flat pale decks, all the masts and
rigging being foreshortened to nothing. We soon
come now to the shadowy, the indistinct&mdash;and
then all is lost in air. Floating clouds fill up all
the space beneath. Lovely colors outspread
themselves, ever-varying in tone, and in their
forms or outlines&mdash;now sweeping in broad lines&mdash;now
rolling and heaving in huge, richly, yet
softly-tinted billows&mdash;while sometimes, through
a great opening, rift, or break, you see a level
expanse of gray or blue fields at an indefinite
depth below. And all this time there is a noiseless
cataract of snowy cloud-rocks falling around
you&mdash;falling swiftly on all sides of the car, in
great fleecy masses&mdash;in small snow-white and
glistening fragments&mdash;and immense compound
masses&mdash;all white, and soft, and swiftly rushing
past you, giddily, and incessantly down, down,
and all with the silence of a dream&mdash;strange,
lustrous, majestic, incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Aeronauts, of late years, have become, in many
instances, respectable and business-like, and not
given to extravagant fictions about their voyages,
which now, more generally, take the form of a
not very lively log. But it used to be very different
when the art was in its infancy, some
thirty or forty years ago, and young balloonists
indulged in romantic fancies. We do not believe
that there was a direct intention to tell falsehoods,
but that they often deceived themselves very
amusingly. Thus, it has been asserted, that
when you attained a great elevation, the air became
so rarefied that you could not breathe, and
that small objects, being thrown out of the balloon,
could not fall, and stuck against the side
of the car. Also, that wild birds, being taken up
and suddenly let loose, could not fly properly, but
returned immediately to the car for an explanation.
One aeronaut declared that his head became
so contracted by his great elevation, that his hat
tumbled over his eyes, and persisted in resting on
the bridge of his nose. This assertion was indignantly
rebutted by another aeronaut of the
same period, who declared that, on the contrary,
the head expanded in proportion to the elevation;
in proof of which he stated, that on his last ascent
he went so high that his hat burst. Another
of these romantic personages described a
wonderful feat of skill and daring which he had
performed up in the air. At an elevation of two
miles, his balloon burst several degrees above
"the equator" (meaning, above the middle region
of the balloon), whereupon he crept up the lines
that attached the car, until he reached the netting
that inclosed the balloon; and up this netting
he clambered, until he reached the aperture,
into which he thrust&mdash;not his head&mdash;but his
pocket handkerchief! Mr. Monck Mason, to
whose "Aeronautica" we are indebted for the
anecdote, gives eight different reasons to show
the impossibility of any such feat having ever
been performed in the air. One of these is highly
graphic. The "performer" would change the
line of gravitation by such an attempt: he would
never be able to mount the sides, and would only
be like the squirrel in its revolving cage. He
would, however, pull the netting round&mdash;the spot
where he clung to, ever remaining the lowest&mdash;until
having reversed the machine, the balloon
would probably make its <i>escape</i>, in an elongated
shape, through the large interstices of that portion
of the net-work which is just above the car,
when the balloon is in its proper position! But
the richest of all these romances is the following
brief statement:&mdash;A scientific gentleman, well
advanced in years (who had "probably witnessed
the experiment of the restoration of a withered
pear beneath the exhausted receiver of a pneumatic
machine") was impressed with a conviction,
on ascending to a considerable height in a balloon,
that every line and wrinkle of his face had totally
disappeared, owing, as he said, to the preternatural
distension of his skin; and that, to the astonishment
of his companion, he rapidly began to
assume the delicate aspect and blooming appearance
of his early youth!</p>

<p>These things are all self-delusions. A bit of
paper or a handkerchief might cling to the outside
of the car, but a penny-piece would, undoubtedly,
fall direct to the earth. Wild birds do not
return to the car, but descend in circles, till, passing
through the clouds, they see whereabouts to
go, and then they fly downward as usual. We
have no difficulty in breathing; on the contrary,
being "called upon," we sing a song. Our head
does not contract, so as to cause our hat to extinguish
our eyes and nose; neither does it expand
to the size of a prize pumpkin. We see
that it is impossible to climb up the netting of the
balloon over-head, and so do not think of attempting
it; neither do we find all the lines in our face
getting filled up, and the loveliness of our "blushing
morning" taking the place of a marked maturity.
These fancies are not less ingenious and
comical than that of the sailor who hit upon the
means of using a balloon to make a rapid voyage
to any part of the earth. "The earth spins
round," said he, "at a great rate, don't it? Well,
I'd go up two or three miles high in my balloon,
and then 'lay to,' and when any place on the
globe I wished to touch at, passed underneath me,
down I'd drop upon it."</p>

<p>But we are still floating high in air. How do
we feel all this time? "Calm, sir&mdash;calm and
resigned." Yes, and more than this. After a
little while, when you find nothing happens, and
see nothing likely to happen (and you will more
especially feel this under the careful conduct of
the veteran Green), a delightful serenity takes
the place of all other sensations&mdash;to which the
extraordinary silence, as well as the pale beauty
and floating hues that surround you, is chiefly
attributable. The silence is perfect&mdash;a wonder
and a rapture. We hear the ticking of our
watches. Tick! tick!&mdash;or is it the beat of our
own hearts? We are sure of the watch; and
now we think we can hear both.</p>

<p>Two other sensations must, by no means, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
forgotten. You become very cold, and desperately
hungry. But you have got a warm outer
coat, and traveling boots, and other valuable
things, and you have not left behind you the
pigeon-pie, the ham, cold beef, bottled ale and
brandy.</p>

<p>Of the increased coldness which you feel on
passing from a bright cloud into a dark one, the
balloon is quite as sensitive as you can be; and,
probably, much more so, for it produces an immediate
change of altitude. The expansion and contraction
which romantic gentlemen fancied took
place in the size of their heads, does really take
place in the balloon, according as it passes from
a cloud of one temperature into that of another.</p>

<p>We are now nearly three miles high. Nothing
is to be seen but pale air above&mdash;around&mdash;on all
sides, with floating clouds beneath. How should
you like to descend in a parachute?&mdash;to be dangled
by a long line from the bottom of the car, and suddenly
to be "let go," and to dip at once clean
down through those gray-blue and softly rose-tinted
clouds, skimming so gently beneath us?
Not at all: oh, by no manner of means&mdash;thank
you! Ah, you are thinking of the fate of poor
Cocking, the enthusiast in parachutes, concerning
whom, and his fatal "improvement," the
public is satisfied that it knows every thing, from
the one final fact&mdash;that he was killed. But there
is something more than that in it, as we fancy.</p>

<p>Two words against parachutes. In the first
place, there is no use to which, at present, they
can be applied; and, in the second, they are so
unsafe as to be likely, in all cases, to cost a life
for each descent. In the concise words of Mr.
Green, we should say&mdash;"the best parachute is a
balloon; the others are bad things to have to
deal with."</p>

<p>Mr. Cocking, as we have said, was an enthusiast
in parachutes. He felt sure he had discovered
a new, and the true, principle. All parachutes,
before his day, had been constructed to
descend in a concave form, like that of an open
umbrella; the consequence of which was, that
the parachute descended with a violent swinging
from side to side, which sometimes threw the
man in the basket in almost a horizontal position.
Mr. Cocking conceived that the converse
form; viz., an inverted cone (of large dimensions),
would remedy this evil; and becoming
convinced, we suppose, by some private experiments
with models, he agreed to descend on a
certain day. The time was barely adequate to
his construction of the parachute, and did not
admit of such actual experiments with a sheep,
or pig, or other animal, as prudence would naturally
have suggested. Besides the want of time,
however, Cocking equally wanted prudence; he
felt sure of his new principle; this new form of
parachute was the hobby of his life, and up he
went on the appointed day (for what aeronaut
shall dare to "disappoint the Public?")&mdash;dangling
by a rope, fifty feet long, from the bottom
of the car of Mr. Green's great Nassau Balloon.</p>

<p>The large upper rim of the parachute, in imitation,
we suppose, of the hollow bones of a
bird, was made of hollow tin&mdash;a most inapplicable
and brittle material; and besides this, it had two
fractures. But Mr. Cocking was not to be deterred;
convinced of the truth of his discovery,
up he would go. Mr. Green was not equally at
ease, and positively refused to touch the latch of
the "liberating iron," which was to detach the
parachute from the balloon. Mr. Cocking arranged
to do this himself, for which means he
procured a piece of new cord of upward of fifty
feet in length, which was fastened to the latch
above in the car, and led down to his hand in the
basket of the parachute. Up they went to a
great height, and disappeared among the clouds.</p>

<p>Mr. Green had taken up one friend with him
in the car; and, knowing well what would happen
the instant so great a weight as the parachute
and man were detached, he had provided a
small balloon inside the car, filled with atmospheric
air, with two mouth-pieces. They were
now upward of a mile high.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Mr. Cocking?" called out
Green. "Never better, or more delighted in my
life," answered Cocking. Though hanging at
fifty feet distance, in the utter silence of that
region, every accent was easily heard. "But,
perhaps you will alter your mind?" suggested
Green. "By no means," cried Cocking; "but,
how high are we?"&mdash;"Upward of a mile."&mdash;"I
must go higher, Mr. Green&mdash;I must be taken up
two miles before I liberate the parachute." Now,
Mr. Green, having some regard for himself and
his friend, as well as for poor Cocking, was determined
not to do any such thing. After some
further colloquy, therefore, during which Mr.
Green threw out a little more ballast, and gained
a little more elevation, he finally announced that
he could go no higher, as he now needed all the
ballast he had for their own safety in the balloon.
"Very well," said Cocking, "if you really will
not take me any higher, I shall say good-by."</p>

<p>At this juncture Green called out, "Now, Mr.
Cocking, if your mind at all misgives you about
your parachute, I have provided a tackle up here,
which I can lower down to you, and then wind
you up into the car by my little grapnel-iron
windlass, and nobody need be the wiser."&mdash;"Certainly
not," cried Cocking; "thank you all
the same. I shall now make ready to pull the
latch-cord." Finding he was determined, Green
and his friend both crouched down in the car,
and took hold of the mouth-pieces of their little
air-balloon. "All ready?" called out Cocking.
"All ready!" answered the veteran aeronaut
above. "Good-night, Mr. Green!"&mdash;"Good-night,
Mr. Cocking!"&mdash;"A pleasant voyage to
you, Mr. Green&mdash;good-night!"</p>

<p>There was a perfect silence&mdash;a few seconds
of intense suspense&mdash;and then the aeronauts in
the car felt a jerk upon the latch. It had not been
forcible enough to open the liberating iron.
Cocking had failed to detach the parachute.
Another pause of horrid silence ensued.</p>

<p>Then came a strong jerk upon the latch, and
in an instant, the great balloon shot upward with
a side-long swirl, like a wounded serpent. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>y
saw their flag clinging flat down against the
flag-staff, while a torrent of gas rushed down
upon them through the aperture in the balloon
above their heads, and continued to pour down
into the car for a length of time that would have
suffocated them but for the judgmatic provision
of the little balloon of atmospheric air, to the
mouth-pieces of which their own mouths were
fixed, as they crouched down at the bottom of
the car. Of Mr. Cocking's fate, or the result of
his experiment, they had not the remotest knowledge.
They only knew the parachute was gone!</p>

<p>The termination of Mr. Cocking's experiment
is well known. For a few seconds he descended
quickly, but steadily, and without swinging&mdash;as
he had designed, and insisted would be the result&mdash;when,
suddenly, those who were watching
with glasses below, saw the parachute lean on
one side&mdash;then give a lurch to the other&mdash;then
the large upper circle collapsed (the disastrous
hollow tin-tubing having evidently broken up),
and the machine entered the upper part of a
cloud: in a few more seconds it was seen to
emerge from the lower part of the cloud&mdash;the
whole thing turned over&mdash;and then, like a closed-up
broken umbrella, it shot straight down to the
earth. The unfortunate, and, as most people regard
him, the foolish enthusiast, was found still
in the basket in which he reached the earth. He
was quite insensible, but uttered a moan; and in
ten minutes he was dead.</p>

<p>Half a word in favor of parachutes. True,
they are of no use "at present;" but who knows
of what use such things may one day be? As
to Mr. Cocking's invention, the disaster seems to
be attributable to errors of detail, rather than of
principle. Mr. Green is of opinion, from an examination
of the <i>broken</i> latch-cord, combined with
other circumstances, which would require diagrams
to describe satisfactorily, that after Mr.
Cocking had failed to liberate himself the first
time, he twisted the cord round his hand to give
a good jerk, forgetting that in doing so, he united
himself to the balloon above, as it would be impossible
to disengage his hand in time. By this
means he was violently jerked into his parachute,
which broke the latch-cord; but the tin tube was
not able to bear such a shock, and this caused so
serious a fracture, in addition to its previous unsound
condition, that it soon afterward collapsed.
This leads one to conjecture that had the outer
rim been made of strong wicker-work, or whale-bone,
so as to be somewhat pliable, and that Mr.
Green had liberated the parachute, instead of Mr.
Cocking, it would have descended to the earth
with perfect safety&mdash;skimming the air, instead of
the violent oscillations of the old form of this machine.
We conclude, however, with Mr. Green's
laconic&mdash;that the safest parachute is a balloon.</p>

<p>But here we are&mdash;still above the clouds! We
may assume that you would not like to be "let
off" in a parachute, even on the improved principle;
we will therefore prepare for descending
with the balloon. This is a work requiring great
skill and care to effect safely, so as to alight on a
suitable piece of ground, and without any detriment
to the voyagers, the balloon, gardens,
crops, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The valve-line is pulled!&mdash;out rushes the gas
from the top of the balloon&mdash;you see the flag fly
upward&mdash;down through the clouds you sink faster
and faster&mdash;lower and lower. Now you begin
to see dark masses below&mdash;there's the Old Earth
again!&mdash;the dark masses now discover themselves
to be little forests, little towns, tree-tops,
house-tops&mdash;out goes a shower of sand from the
ballast-bags, and our descent becomes slower&mdash;another
shower, and up we mount again, in
search of a better spot to alight upon. Our
guardian aeronaut gives each of us a bag of ballast,
and directs us to throw out its contents
when he calls each of us by name, and in such
quantities only as he specifies. Moreover, no
one is suddenly to leap out of the balloon, when
it touches the earth; partly because it may cost
him his own life or limbs, and partly because it
would cause the balloon to shoot up again with
those who remained, and so make them lose the
advantage of the good descent already gained, if
nothing worse happened. Meantime, the grapnel-iron
has been lowered, and dangling down at
the end of a strong rope of a hundred and fifty
feet long. It is now trailing over the ground.
Three bricklayers' laborers are in chase of it. It
catches upon a bank&mdash;it tears its way through.
Now the three bricklayers are joined by a couple
of fellows in smock-frocks, a policeman, five boys,
followed by three little girls, and, last of all, a
woman with a child in her arms, all running,
shouting, screaming, and yelling, as the grapnel-iron
and rope go trailing and bobbing over the
ground before them. At last the iron catches
upon a hedge&mdash;grapples with its roots; the balloon
is arrested, but struggles hard; three or
four men seize the rope, and down we are hauled,
and held fast till the aerial Monster, with many a
gigantic heave and pant, surrenders at discretion,
and begins to resign its inflated robust proportions.
It subsides in irregular waves&mdash;sinks,
puffs, flattens&mdash;dies to a mere shriveled skin;
and being folded up, like Peter Schlemil's shadow,
is put into a bag, and stowed away at the
bottom of the little car it so recently overshadowed
with its buoyant enormity.</p>

<p>We are glad it is all over; delighted, and edified
as we have been, we are very glad to take
our supper at the solid, firmly-fixed oak table of
a country inn, with a brick wall and a barn-door
for our only prospect, as the evening closes in.
Of etherial currents, and the scenery of infinite
space, we have had enough for the present.</p>

<p>Touching the accidents which occur to balloons,
we feel persuaded that in the great majority
of cases they are caused by inexperience,
ignorance, rashness, folly, or&mdash;more commonly
than all&mdash;the necessities attending a "show."
Once "announced" for a certain day, or <i>night</i>
(an abominable practice, which ought to be prevented)&mdash;and,
whatever the state of the wind
and weather, and whatever science and the good
sense of an experienced aeronaut may know and
suggest of imprudence&mdash;up the poor man must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
go, simply because the public have paid their
money to see him do it. He must go, or he will
be ruined.</p>

<p>But nothing can more strikingly display the
comparative safety which is attained by great
knowledge, foresight, and care, than the fact of the
veteran, Charles Green, being now in the four
hundred and eighty-ninth year of his balloonical
age; having made that number of ascents, and
taken up one thousand four hundred and thirteen
persons, with no fatal accident to himself, or to
them, and seldom with any damage to his balloons.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, from causes over which he had
no control, our veteran has had two or three
"close shaves." On one occasion he was blown
out to sea with the Great Nassau balloon. Observing
some vessels, from which he knew he
should obtain assistance, he commenced a rapid
descent in the direction of the Nore. The valve
was opened, and the car first struck the water
some two miles north of Sheerness. But the
wind was blowing fresh, and, by reason of the
buoyancy of the balloon, added to the enormous
surface it presented to the wind, they were drawn
through the water at a speed which set defiance
to all the vessels and boats that were now out on
the chase. It should be mentioned, that the
speed was so vehement, and the car so un-boat-like,
that the aeronauts (Mr. Green and Mr. Rush,
of Elsenham Hall, Essex) were dragged through,
that is <i>under</i>, every wave they encountered, and
had a good prospect of being drowned upon the
surface. Seeing that the balloon could not be
overtaken, Mr. Green managed to let go his large
grapnel-iron, which shortly afterward took effect
at the bottom, where, by a fortunate circumstance
(for them) there was a sunken wreck, in which
the iron took hold. The progress of the balloon
being thus arrested, a boat soon came up, and
relieved the aeronauts; but no boat could venture
to approach the monster balloon, which still continued
to struggle, and toss, and bound from side
to side. It would have capsized any boat that
came near it, in an instant. It was impossible
to do any thing with it till Mr. Green obtained
assistance from a revenue cutter, from which he
solicited the services of an armed boat, and the
crew fired muskets with ball-cartridge into the
rolling Monster, until she gradually sank down
flat upon the waves, but not until she had been
riddled with sixty-two bullet holes.</p>

<p>So much for perils by sea; but the greatest of
all the veteran's dangers was caused by a diabolical
trick, the perpetrator of which was never
discovered. It was as follows:</p>

<p>In the year 1832, on ascending from Cheltenham,
one of those malicious wretches who may
be regarded as half fool and half devil, contrived
partially to sever the ropes of the car, in such a
manner as not to be perceived before the balloon
had quited the ground; when receiving, for the
first time, the whole weight of the contents, they
suddenly gave way. Every thing fell out of the
car, the aeronauts just having time to secure a
painful and precarious attachment to the hoop.
Lightened of its load, the balloon, with frightful
velocity, immediately commenced its upward
course, and ere Mr. Green could obtain possession
of the valve-string, which the first violence
of the accident had placed beyond his reach, attained
an altitude of upward of ten thousand feet.
Their situation was terrific. Clinging to the
hoop with desperate retention, not daring to trust
any portion of their weight upon the margin of
the car, that still remained suspended by a single
cord beneath their feet, lest that also might give
way, and they should be deprived of their only
remaining counterpoise, all they could do was to
resign themselves to chance, and endeavor to retain
their hold until the exhaustion of the gas
should have determined the career of the balloon.
To complete the horrors of their situation, the
net-work, drawn awry by the awkward and unequal
disposition of the weight, began to break
about the upper part of the machine&mdash;mesh after
mesh giving way, with a succession of reports
like those of a pistol; while, through the opening
thus created, the balloon began rapidly to ooze
out, and swelling as it escaped beyond the fissure,
presented the singular appearance of a huge
hour-glass floating in the upper regions of the
sky. After having continued for a considerable
length of time in this condition, every moment
expecting to be precipitated to the earth by the
final detachment of the balloon, at length they
began slowly to descend. When they had arrived
within about a hundred feet from the ground,
the event they had anticipated at length
occurred; the balloon, rushing through the opening
in the net-work with a tremendous explosion,
suddenly made its escape, and they fell to the
earth in a state of insensibility, from which with
great difficulty, they were eventually recovered.</p>

<p>Apart from the question of dangers, which
science, as we have seen, can reduce to a minimum&mdash;and
apart also from the question of practical
utility, of which we do not see much at
present, yet of which we know not what may be
derived in future&mdash;what are the probabilities of
improvement in the art of ballooning, aerostation,
or the means of traveling through the air in a
given direction?</p>

<p>The conditions seem to be these. In order to
fly in the air, and steer in a given direction during
a given period, it is requisite to take up a
buoyancy and a power which shall be greater
(and continuously so during the voyage) than
needful to sustain its own mechanical weight,
together with that of the aeronauts and their
various appurtenances; and as much also in
excess of these requisitions as shall overcome
the adverse action of the wind upon the resisting
surface presented by the machine. At present
no such power is known which can be used in
combination with a balloon, or other gas machine.
If we could condense electricity, then the thing
might be done; other subtle powers may also be
discovered with the progress of science, but we
must wait for them before we can fairly make
definite voyages in the air, and reduce human
flying to a practical utility, or a safe and rational
pleasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<h3>BOOK VIII.&mdash;INITIAL CHAPTER.</h3>

<h4>THE ABUSE OF INTELLECT.</h4>


<p>There is at present so vehement a flourish
of trumpets, and so prodigious a roll of the
drum, whenever we are called upon to throw up
our hats, and cry "Huzza" to the "March of
Enlightenment," that, out of that very spirit of
contradiction natural to all rational animals, one
is tempted to stop one's ears, and say, "Gently,
gently; <span class="smcap">light</span> is noiseless; how comes 'Enlightenment'
to make such a clatter? Meanwhile,
if it be not impertinent, pray, where is enlightenment
marching to?" Ask that question of any
six of the loudest bawlers in the procession, and
I'll wager ten-pence to California that you get
six very unsatisfactory answers. One respectable
gentleman, who, to our great astonishment,
insists upon calling himself a "slave," but has a
remarkably free way of expressing his opinions,
will reply&mdash;"Enlightenment is marching toward
the nine points of the Charter." Another, with
his hair <i>&agrave; la jeune France</i>, who has taken a fancy
to his friend's wife, and is rather embarrassed
with his own, asserts that Enlightenment is proceeding
toward the Rights of Women, the reign
of Social Love, and the annihilation of Tyrannical
Prejudice. A third, who has the air of a man
well to do in the middle class, more modest in
his hopes, because he neither wishes to have his
head broken by his errand-boy, nor his wife carried
off to an Agapemon&eacute; by his apprentice, does
not take Enlightenment a step further than a
siege on Debrett, and a cannonade on the Budget.
Illiberal man! the march that he swells will soon
trample <i>him</i> under foot. No one fares so ill in
a crowd as the man who is wedged in the middle.
A fourth, looking wild and dreamy, as if
he had come out of the cave of Trophonius, and
who is a mesmeriser and a mystic, thinks Enlightenment
is in full career toward the good old days
of alchemists and necromancers. A fifth, whom
one might take for a Quaker, asserts that the
march of Enlightenment is a crusade for universal
philanthropy, vegetable diet, and the perpetuation
of peace, by means of speeches, which
certainly do produce a very contrary effect from
the Philippics of Demosthenes! The sixth&mdash;(good
fellow, without a rag on his back)&mdash;does
not care a straw where the march goes. He
can't be worse off than he is; and it is quite immaterial
to him whether he goes to the dogstar
above, or the bottomless pit below. I say nothing,
however, against the march, while we
take it all together. Whatever happens, one is
in good company; and though I am somewhat
indolent by nature, and would rather stay at
home with Locke and Burke (dull dogs though
they were), than have my thoughts set off helter-skelter
with those cursed trumpets and drums,
blown and dub-a-dubbed by fellows that I vow to
Heaven I would not trust with a five-pound note&mdash;still,
if I must march, I must; and so deuce
take the hindmost. But when it comes to individual
marchers upon their own account&mdash;privateers
and condottieri of Enlightenment&mdash;who
have filled their pockets with lucifer-matches,
and have a sublime contempt for their neighbors'
barns and hay-ricks, I don't see why I should
throw myself into the seventh heaven of admiration
and ecstasy.</p>

<p>If those who are eternally rhapsodizing on the
celestial blessings that are to follow Enlightenment,
Universal Knowledge, and so forth, would
just take their eyes out of their pockets, and look
about them, I would respectfully inquire if they
have never met any very knowing and enlightened
gentleman, whose acquaintance is by no
means desirable. If not, they are monstrous
lucky. Every man must judge by his own experience;
and the worst rogues I have ever encountered
were amazingly well-informed, clever
fellows! From dunderheads and dunces we can
protect ourselves; but from your sharp-witted
gentleman, all enlightenment and no prejudice,
we have but to cry, "Heaven defend us!" It
is true, that the rogue (let him be ever so enlightened)
usually comes to no good himself
(though not before he has done harm enough to
his neighbors). But that only shows that the
world wants something else in those it rewards,
besides intelligence <i>per se</i> and in the abstract;
and is much too old a world to allow any Jack
Horner to pick out its plums for his own personal
gratification. Hence a man of very moderate
intelligence, who believes in God, suffers his
heart to beat with human sympathies, and keeps
his eyes off your strong-box, will perhaps gain
a vast deal more power than knowledge ever
gives to a rogue.</p>

<p>Wherefore, though I anticipate an outcry
against me on the part of the blockheads, who,
strange to say, are the most credulous idolators
of enlightenment, and, if knowledge were power,
would rot on a dunghill; yet, nevertheless, I think
all really enlightened men will agree with me,
that when one falls in with detached sharpshooters
from the general march of enlightenment, it
is no reason that we should make ourselves a
target, because enlightenment has furnished them
with a gun. It has, doubtless, been already remarked
by the judicious reader, that of the numerous
characters introduced into this work, the
larger portion belong to that species which we
call the <span class="smcap">Intellectual</span>&mdash;that through them are
analyzed and developed human intellect, in
various forms and directions. So that this History,
rightly considered, is a kind of humble,
familiar Epic, or, if you prefer it, a long Serio-Comedy,
upon the varieties of English Life in
this our century, set in movement by the intelligences
most prevalent. And where more ordinary
and less refined types of the species round
and complete the survey of our passing generation,
they will often suggest, by contrast, the deficiencies
which mere intellectual culture leaves
in the human being. Certainly I have no spite
against intellect and enlightenment. Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
forbid I should be such a Goth. I am only the
advocate for common sense and fair play. I
don't think an able man necessarily an angel;
but I think if his heart match his head, and both
proceed in the Great March under a divine Oriflamme,
he goes as near to the angel as humanity
will permit: if not, if he has but a penn'orth
of heart to a pound of brains, I say, "<i>Bonjour,
mon ange?</i> I see not the starry upward wings,
but the groveling cloven-hoof." I'd rather be
offuscated by the Squire of Hazeldean, than enlightened
by Randal Leslie. Every man to his
taste. But intellect itself (not in the philosophical,
but the ordinary sense of the term) is rarely,
if ever, one completed harmonious agency; it is
not one faculty, but a compound of many, some
of which are often at war with each other, and
mar the concord of the whole. Few of us but have
some predominant faculty, in itself a strength;
but which (usurping unseasonably dominion over
the rest), shares the lot of all tyranny, however
brilliant, and leaves the empire weak against
disaffection within, and invasion from without.
Hence intellect may be perverted in a man of
evil disposition, and sometimes merely wasted
in a man of excellent impulses, for want of the
necessary discipline, or of a strong ruling motive.
I doubt if there be one person in the world, who
has obtained a high reputation for talent, who
has not met somebody much cleverer than himself,
which said somebody has never obtained
any reputation at all! Men like Audley Egerton
are constantly seen in the great positions
of life; while men like Harley L'Estrange, who
could have beaten them hollow in any thing
equally striven for by both, float away down the
stream, and, unless some sudden stimulant arouse
the dreamy energies, vanish out of sight into silent
graves. If Hamlet and Polonius were living
now, Polonius would have a much better chance
of being Chancellor of the Exchequer, though
Hamlet would unquestionably be a much more
intellectual character. What would become of
Hamlet? Heaven knows! Dr. Arnold said,
from his experience of a school, that the difference
between one man and another was not mere
ability&mdash;it was energy. There is a great deal
of truth in that saying.</p>

<p>Submitting these hints to the judgment and
penetration of the sagacious, I enter on the fresh
division of this work, and see already Randal Leslie
gnawing his lip on the back ground. The
German poet observes, that the Cow of Isis is to
some the divine symbol of knowledge, to others
but the milch cow, only regarded for the pounds
of butter she will yield. O, tendency of our age,
to look on Isis as the milch cow! O, prostitution
of the grandest desires to the basest uses!
Gaze on the goddess, Randal Leslie, and get
ready thy churn and thy scales. Let us see
what the butter will fetch in the market.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>A new reign has commenced. There has
been a general election; the unpopularity of the
Administration has been apparent at the hustings.
Audley Egerton, hitherto returned by
vast majorities, has barely escaped defeat&mdash;thanks
to a majority of five. The expenses of
his election are said to have been prodigious.
"But who can stand against such wealth as
Egerton's&mdash;no doubt, backed, too, by the Treasury
purse?" said the defeated candidate. It is
toward the close of October; London is already
full; Parliament will meet in less than a fortnight.</p>

<p>In one of the principal apartments of that hotel
in which foreigners may discover what is
meant by English comfort, and the price which
foreigners must pay for it, there sat two persons,
side by side, engaged in close conversation. The
one was a female, in whose pale, clear complexion
and raven hair&mdash;in whose eyes, vivid with a
power of expression rarely bestowed on the beauties
of the north, we recognize Beatrice, Marchesa
di Negra. Undeniably handsome as was
the Italian lady, her companion, though a man,
and far advanced into middle age, was yet more
remarkable for personal advantages. There was
a strong family likeness between the two; but
there was also a striking contrast in air, manner,
and all that stamps on the physiognomy the
idiosyncrasies of character. There was something
of gravity, of earnestness and passion, in
Beatrice's countenance when carefully examined;
her smile at times might be false, but it
was rarely ironical, never cynical. Her gestures,
though graceful, were unrestrained and
frequent. You could see she was a daughter of
the south. Her companion, on the contrary, preserved
on the fair smooth face, to which years
had given scarcely a line or wrinkle, something
that might have passed, at first glance, for the
levity and thoughtlessness of a gay and youthful
nature; but the smile, though exquisitely polished,
took at times the derision of a sneer. In
his manners he was as composed and as free from
gesture as an Englishman. His hair was of that
red brown with which the Italian painters produce
such marvelous effects of color; and, if here
and there a silver thread gleamed through the
locks, it was lost at once amid their luxuriance.
His eyes were light, and his complexion, though
without much color, was singularly transparent.
His beauty, indeed, would have been rather womanly
than masculine, but for the height and sinewy
spareness of a frame in which muscular
strength was rather adorned than concealed by
an admirable elegance of proportion. You would
never have guessed this man to be an Italian:
more likely you would have supposed him a Parisian.
He conversed in French, his dress was
of French fashion, his mode of thought seemed
French. Not that he was like the Frenchman of
the present day&mdash;an animal, either rude or reserved;
but your ideal of the <i>Marquis</i> of the old
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>&mdash;the <i>rou&eacute;</i> of the Regency.</p>

<p>Italian, however, he was, and of a race renowned
in Italian history. But, as if ashamed
of his country and his birth, he affected to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
citizen of the world. Heaven help the world if
it hold only such citizens!</p>

<p>"But, Giulio," said Beatrice di Negra, speaking
in Italian, "even granting that you discover
this girl, can you suppose that her father will
ever consent to your alliance? Surely you know
too well the nature of your kinsman?"</p>

<p>"<i>Tu te trompes, ma s&#339;ur</i>," replied Giulio
Franzini, Count di Peschiera, in French as usual&mdash;"<i>tu
te trompes</i>; I knew it before he had gone
through exile and penury. How can I know it
now? But comfort yourself, my too anxious
Beatrice; I shall not care for his consent till I
have made sure of his daughter's."</p>

<p>"But how win that in despite of the father?"</p>

<p>"<i>Eh, mordieu!</i>" interrupted the Count, with
true French gayety; "what would become of all
the comedies ever written, if marriages were not
made in despite of the father? Look you," he
resumed, with a very slight compression of his
lip, and a still slighter movement in his chair&mdash;"look
you, this is no question of ifs and buts; it
is a question of must and shall&mdash;a question of existence
to you and to me. When Danton was
condemned to the guillotine, he said, flinging a
pellet of bread at the nose of his respectable
judge&mdash;'<i>Mon individu sera bient&ocirc;t dans le n&eacute;ant</i>'&mdash;<i>My</i>
patrimony is there already! I am loaded
with debts. I see before me, on the one side,
ruin or suicide; on the other side, wedlock and
wealth."</p>

<p>"But from those vast possessions which you
have been permitted to enjoy so long, have you
really saved nothing against the time when they
might be reclaimed at your hands?"</p>

<p>"My sister," replied the Count, "do I look
like a man who saved? Besides, when the Austrian
Emperor, unwilling to raze from his Lombard
domains a name and a house so illustrious
as our kinsman's, and desirous, while punishing
that kinsman's rebellion, to reward my adherence,
forbore the peremptory confiscation of
those vast possessions, at which my mouth waters
while we speak, but, annexing them to the
Crown during pleasure, allowed me, as the next
of male kin, to retain the revenues of one half for
the same very indefinite period&mdash;had I not every
reason to suppose, that, before long, I could so
influence his majesty or his minister, as to obtain
a decree that might transfer the whole, unconditionally
and absolutely, to myself? And,
methinks, I should have done so, but for this accursed,
intermeddling English milord, who has
never ceased to besiege the court or the minister
with alleged extenuations of our cousin's rebellion,
and proofless assertions that I shared it
in order to entangle my kinsman, and betrayed
it in order to profit by his spoils. So that, at
last, in return for all my services, and in answer
to all my claims, I received from the minister
himself this cold reply&mdash;'Count of Peschiera,
your aid was important, and your reward has
been large. That reward, it would not be for
your honor to extend, and justify the ill-opinion
of your Italian countrymen, by formally appropriating
to yourself all that was forfeited by the
treason you denounced. A name so noble as
yours should be dearer to you than fortune itself.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, Giulio!" cried Beatrice, her face lighting
up, changed in its whole character&mdash;"those
were words that might make the demon that
tempts to avarice, fly from your breast in shame."</p>

<p>The Count opened his eyes in great amaze;
then he glanced round the room, and said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Nobody else hears you, my dear Beatrice;
talk common sense. Heroics sound well in
mixed society; but there is nothing less suited
to the tone of a family conversation."</p>

<p>Madame di Negra bent down her head abashed,
and that sudden change in the expression of
her countenance, which had seemed to betray
susceptibility to generous emotion, faded as suddenly
away.</p>

<p>"But still," she said, coldly, "you enjoy one
half of those ample revenues&mdash;why talk, then, of
suicide and ruin?"</p>

<p>"I enjoy them at the pleasure of the crown;
and what if it be the pleasure of the crown to recall
our cousin, and reinstate him in his possessions?"</p>

<p>"There is a <i>probability</i>, then, of that pardon?
When you first employed me in your researches,
you only thought there was a <i>possibility</i>."</p>

<p>"There is a great probability of it, and therefore
I am here. I learned some little time since
that the question of such recall had been suggested
by the Emperor, and discussed in Council.
The danger to the State, which might arise
from our cousin's wealth, his alleged abilities&mdash;(abilities!
bah!)&mdash;and his popular name, deferred
any decision on the point; and, indeed, the difficulty
of dealing with myself must have embarrassed
the ministry. But it is a mere question
of time. He can not long remain excluded from
the general amnesty, already extended to the
other refugees. The person who gave me this
information is high in power, and friendly to myself;
and he added a piece of advice, on which
I acted. 'It was intimated,' said he, 'by one of
the partisans of your kinsman, that the exile could
give a hostage for his loyalty in the person of his
daughter and heiress; that she had arrived at
marriageable age; that if she were to wed, with
the Emperor's consent, some one whose attachment
to the Austrian crown was unquestionable,
there would be a guarantee both for the faith of
the father, and for the transmission of so important
a heritage to safe and loyal hands. Why
not' (continued my friend) 'apply to the Emperor
for his consent to that alliance for yourself? you,
on whom he can depend; you who, if the daughter
should die, would be the legal heir to those
lands?' On that hint I spoke."</p>

<p>"You saw the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"And after combating the unjust prepossessions
against me, I stated, that so far from my
cousin having any fair cause of resentment
against me, when all was duly explained to
him, I did not doubt that he would willingly
give me the hand of his child."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"You did!" cried the Marchesa, amazed.</p>

<p>"And," continued the Count, imperturbably,
as he smoothed, with careless hand, the snowy
plaits of his shirt front&mdash;"and that I should thus
have the happiness of becoming myself the guarantee
of my kinsman's loyalty&mdash;the agent for the
restoration of his honors, while, in the eyes of
the envious and malignant, I should clear up my
own name from all suspicion that I had wronged
him."</p>

<p>"And the Emperor consented?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu</i>, my dear sister. What else could
his majesty do? My proposition smoothed every
obstacle, and reconciled policy with mercy. It
remains, therefore, only to find out, what has
hitherto baffled all our researches, the retreat of
our dear kinsfolk, and to make myself a welcome
lover to the demoiselle. There is some disparity
of years, I own; but&mdash;unless your sex and my
glass flatter me overmuch&mdash;I am still a match
for many a gallant of five-and-twenty."</p>

<p>The Count said this with so charming a smile,
and looked so pre-eminently handsome, that he
carried off the coxcombry of the words as gracefully
as if they had been spoken by some dazzling
hero of the grand old comedy of Parisian
life.</p>

<p>Then interlacing his fingers, and lightly leaning
his hands, thus clasped, upon his sister's
shoulder, he looked into her face, and said slowly&mdash;"And
now, my sister, for some gentle but deserved
reproach. Have you not sadly failed me
in the task I imposed on your regard for my interests?
Is it not some years since you first came
to England on the mission of discovering these
worthy relatives of ours? Did I not entreat you
to seduce into your toils the man whom I knew
to be my enemy, and who was indubitably acquainted
with our cousin's retreat&mdash;a secret he
has hitherto locked within his bosom? Did you
not tell me, that though he was then in England,
you could find no occasion even to meet him, but
that you had obtained the friendship of the statesman
to whom I directed your attention as his
most intimate associate? And yet you, whose
charms are usually so irresistible, learn nothing
from the statesman, as you see nothing of <i>milord</i>.
Nay, baffled and misled, you actually supposed
that the quarry has taken refuge in France. You
go thither&mdash;you pretend to search the capital&mdash;the
provinces, Switzerland, <i>que sais-je?</i> all in vain&mdash;though&mdash;<i>-foi
de gentilhomme</i>&mdash;your police cost
me dearly&mdash;you return to England&mdash;the same
chase and the same result. <i>Palsambleu, ma s&#339;ur</i>,
I do too much credit to your talents not to question
your zeal. In a word have you been in earnest&mdash;or
have you not had some womanly pleasure in
amusing yourself and abusing my trust?"</p>

<p>"Giulio," answered Beatrice, sadly, "you
know the influence you have exercised over my
character and my fate. Your reproaches are
not just. I made such inquiries as were in my
power, and I have now cause to believe that I
know one who is possessed of this secret, and
can guide us to it."</p>

<p>"Ah, you do!" exclaimed the Count. Beatrice
did not heed the exclamation, but hurried on.</p>

<p>"But grant that my heart shrunk from the
task you imposed on me, would it not have been
natural? When I first came to England, you
informed me that your object in discovering the
exiles was one which I could honestly aid. You
naturally desired first to know if the daughter
lived; if not, you were the heir. If she did, you
assured me you desired to effect, through my
mediation, some liberal compromise with Alphonso,
by which you would have sought to obtain
his restoration, provided he would leave you
for life in possession of the grant you hold from
the crown. While these were your objects, I
did my best, ineffectual as it was, to obtain the
information required."</p>

<p>"And what made me lose so important though
so ineffectual an ally?" asked the Count, still
smiling; but a gleam that belied the smile shot
from his eye.</p>

<p>"What! when you bade me receive and co-operate
with the miserable spies&mdash;the false Italians&mdash;whom
you sent over, and seek to entangle
this poor exile, when found, in some rash correspondence,
to be revealed to the court; when
you sought to seduce the daughter of the Counts
of Peschiera, the descendant of those who had
ruled in Italy, into the informer, the corrupter,
and the traitress! No, Giulio&mdash;then I recoiled;
and then, fearful of your own sway over me, I
retreated into France. I have answered you
frankly."</p>

<p>The Count removed his hands from the shoulders
on which they had reclined so cordially.</p>

<p>"And this," said he, "is your wisdom, and
this your gratitude. You, whose fortunes are
bound up in mine&mdash;you, who subsist on my bounty&mdash;you,
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold," cried the Marchesa, rising, and with
a burst of emotion, as if stung to the utmost, and
breaking into revolt from the tyranny of years&mdash;"Hold&mdash;gratitude!
bounty! Brother, brother&mdash;what,
indeed, do I owe to you? The shame
and the misery of a life. While yet a child, you
condemned me to marry against my will&mdash;against
my heart&mdash;against my prayers&mdash;and
laughed at my tears when I knelt to you for
mercy. I was pure then, Giulio&mdash;pure and innocent
as the flowers in my virgin crown. And
now&mdash;now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Beatrice stopped abruptly, and clasped her
hands before her face.</p>

<p>"Now you upbraid me," said the Count, unruffled
by her sudden passion, "because I gave
you in marriage to a man young and noble?"</p>

<p>"Old in vices and mean of soul! The marriage
I forgave you. You had the right, according
to the customs of our country, to dispose
of my hand. But I forgave you not the consolations
that you whispered in the ear of a wretched
and insulted wife."</p>

<p>"Pardon me the remark," replied the Count,
with a courtly bend of his head, "but those consolations
were also conformable to the customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of our country, and I was not aware till now that
you had wholly disdained them. And," continued
the Count, "you were not so long a wife
that the gall of the chain should smart still. You
were soon left a widow&mdash;free, childless, young,
beautiful."</p>

<p>"And penniless."</p>

<p>"True, Di Negra was a gambler, and very
unlucky; no fault of mine. I could neither keep
the cards from his hands, nor advise him how to
play them."</p>

<p>"And my own portion? Oh, Giulio, I knew
but at his death why you had condemned me to
that renegade Genoese. He owed you money,
and, against honor, and, I believe, against law,
you had accepted my fortune in discharge of the
debt."</p>

<p>"He had no other way to discharge it&mdash;a debt
of honor must be paid&mdash;old stories these. What
matters? Since then my purse has been open
to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, not as your sister, but your instrument&mdash;your
spy! Yes, your purse has been open&mdash;with
a niggard hand."</p>

<p>"<i>Un peu de conscience, ma ch&egrave;re</i>, you are so
extravagant. But come, be plain. What would
you?"</p>

<p>"I would be free from you."</p>

<p>"That is, you would form some second marriage
with one of these rich island lords. <i>Ma
foi</i>, I respect your ambition."</p>

<p>"It is not so high. I aim but to escape from
slavery&mdash;to be placed beyond dishonorable temptation.
I desire," cried Beatrice with increased
emotion, "I desire to re-enter the life of woman."</p>

<p>"Eno'!" said the Count with a visible impatience,
"is there any thing in the attainment of
your object that should render you indifferent
to mine? You desire to marry, if I comprehend
you right. And to marry, as becomes you, you
should bring to your husband not debts, but a
dowry. Be it so. I will restore the portion
that I saved from the spendthrift clutch of the
Genoese&mdash;the moment that it is mine to bestow&mdash;the
moment that I am husband to my kinsman's
heiress. And now, Beatrice, you imply
that my former notions revolted your conscience;
my present plan should content it; for by this
marriage shall our kinsman regain his country,
and repossess, at least, half his lands. And if I
am not an excellent husband to the demoiselle,
it will be her own fault. I have sown my wild
oats. <i>Je suis bon prince</i>, when I have things a
little my own way. It is my hope and my intention,
and certainly it will be my interest, to
become <i>digne &eacute;poux et irr&eacute;proachable p&egrave;re de famille</i>.
I speak lightly&mdash;'tis my way. I mean
seriously. The little girl will be very happy
with me, and I shall succeed in soothing all resentment
her father may retain. Will you aid
me then&mdash;yes or no? Aid me, and you shall
indeed be free. The magician will release the
fair spirit he has bound to his will. Aid me not,
<i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>, and mark, I do not threaten&mdash;I do but
warn&mdash;aid me not; grant that I become a beggar,
and ask yourself what is to become of you&mdash;still
young, still beautiful, and still penniless?
Nay, worse than penniless; you have done me
the honor" (and here the Count, looking on the
table, drew a letter from a portfolio, emblazoned
with his arms and coronet), "you have done me
the honor to consult me as to your debts."</p>

<p>"You will restore my fortune?" said the
Marchesa, irresolutely&mdash;and averting her head
from an odious schedule of figures.</p>

<p>"When my own, with your aid, is secured."</p>

<p>"But do you not overate the value of my aid?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," said the Count, with a caressing
suavity&mdash;and he kissed his sister's forehead.</p>

<p>"Possibly; but by my honor, I wish to repair to
you any wrong, real or supposed, I may have
done you in past times. I wish to find again
my own dear sister. I may overvalue your aid,
but not the affection from which it comes. Let
us be friends, <i>cara Beatrice mia</i>," added the
Count, for the first time employing Italian words.</p>

<p>The Marchesa laid her head on his shoulder,
and her tears flowed softly. Evidently this man
had great influence over her&mdash;and evidently,
whatever her cause for complaint, her affection
for him was still sisterly and strong. A nature
with fine flashes of generosity, spirit, honor, and
passion, was hers&mdash;but uncultured, unguided&mdash;spoilt
by the worst social examples&mdash;easily led
into wrong&mdash;not always aware where the wrong
was&mdash;letting affections good or bad whisper
away her conscience, or blind her reason. Such
women are often far more dangerous when induced
to wrong, than those who are thoroughly
abandoned&mdash;such women are the accomplices
men like the Count of Peschiera most desire to
obtain.</p>

<p>"Ah, Giulio," said Beatrice, after a pause,
and looking up at him through her tears, "when
you speak to me thus, you know you can do
with me what you will. Fatherless and motherless,
whom had my childhood to love and obey
but you?"</p>

<p>"Dear Beatrice," murmured the Count tenderly&mdash;and
he again kissed her forehead. "So,"
he continued more carelessly&mdash;"so the reconciliation
is effected, and our interests and our
hearts re-allied. Now, alas, to descend to business.
You say that you know some one whom
you believe to be acquainted with the lurking-place
of my father-in-law&mdash;that is to be!"</p>

<p>"I think so. You remind me that I have an
appointment with him this day; it is near the
hour&mdash;I must leave you."</p>

<p>"To learn the secret?&mdash;Quick&mdash;quick. I
have no fear of your success, if it is by his heart
that you lead him?"</p>

<p>"You mistake; on his heart I have no hold.
But he has a friend who loves me, and honorably,
and whose cause he pleads. I think here
that I have some means to control or persuade
him. If not&mdash;ah, he is of a character that perplexes
me in all but his worldly ambition; and
how can we foreigners influence him through
<i>that</i>?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is he poor, or is he extravagant?"</p>

<p>"Not extravagant, and not positively poor,
but dependent."</p>

<p>"Then we have him," said the Count composedly.
"If his assistance be worth buying,
we can bid high for it. <i>Sur mon &acirc;me</i>, I never
yet knew money fail with any man who was both
worldly and dependent. I put him and myself
in your hands."</p>

<p>Thus saying, the Count opened the door, and
conducted his sister with formal politeness to
her carriage. He then returned, reseated himself,
and mused in silence. As he did so, the
muscles of his countenance relaxed. The levity
of the Frenchman fled from his visage, and in
his eye, as it gazed abstractedly into space, there
was that steady depth so remarkable in the old
portraits of Florentine diplomatist, or Venetian
oligarch. Thus seen, there was in that face,
despite all its beauty, something that would have
awed back even the fond gaze of love; something
hard, collected, inscrutable, remorseless,
but this change of countenance did not last
long. Evidently, thought, though intense for the
moment, was not habitual to the man. Evidently,
he had lived the life which takes all things lightly&mdash;so
he rose with a look of fatigue, shook and
stretched himself, as if to cast off, or grow out
of an unwelcome and irksome mood. An hour
afterward, the Count of Peschiera was charming
all eyes, and pleasing all ears, in the saloon of a
high-born beauty, whose acquaintance he had
made at Vienna, and whose charms, according
to that old and never truth-speaking oracle,
Polite Scandal, were now said to have attracted
to London the brilliant foreigner.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>The Marchesa regained her house, which was
in Curzon-street, and withdrew to her own room,
to re-adjust her dress, and remove from her
countenance all trace of the tears she had shed.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour afterward she was seated in her
drawing-room, composed and calm; nor, seeing
her then, could you have guessed that she was
capable of so much emotion and so much weakness.
In that stately exterior, in that quiet attitude,
in that elaborate and finished elegance
which comes alike from the arts of the toilet
and the conventional repose of rank, you could
see but the woman of the world and the great
lady.</p>

<p>A knock at the door was heard, and in a few
moments there entered a visitor, with the easy
familiarity of intimate acquaintance&mdash;a young
man, but with none of the bloom of youth. His
hair, fine as a woman's, was thin and scanty,
but it fell low over the forehead, and concealed
that noblest of our human features. "A gentleman,"
says Apuleius, "ought, if he can, to
wear his whole mind on his forehead."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The
young visitor would never have committed so
frank an imprudence. His cheek was pale, and
in his step and his movements there was a languor
that spoke of fatigued nerves or delicate
health. But the light of the eye and the tone
of the voice were those of a mental temperament
controlling the bodily&mdash;vigorous and energetic.
For the rest his general appearance was distinguished
by a refinement alike intellectual and
social. Once seen, you would not easily forget
him. And the reader no doubt already recognizes
Randal Leslie. His salutation, as I before
said, was that of intimate familiarity; yet it was
given and replied to with that unreserved openness
which denotes the absence of a more tender
sentiment.</p>

<p>Seating himself by the Marchesa's side, Randal
began first to converse on the fashionable
topics and gossip of the day; but it was observable,
that, while he extracted from her the current
anecdote and scandal of the great world,
neither anecdote nor scandal did he communicate
in return. Randal Leslie had already learned
the art not to commit himself, not to have quoted
against him one ill-natured remark upon the
eminent. Nothing more injures the man who
would rise beyond the fame of the <i>salons</i>, than
to be considered a backbiter and gossip; "yet it
is always useful," thought Randal Leslie, "to
know the foibles&mdash;the small social and private
springs by which the great are moved. Critical
occasions may arise in which such knowledge
may be power." And hence, perhaps (besides
a more private motive, soon to be perceived),
Randal did not consider his time thrown away
in cultivating Madame di Negra's friendship.
For despite much that was whispered against
her, she had succeeded in dispelling the coldness
with which she had at first been received in the
London circles. Her beauty, her grace, and
her high birth, had raised her into fashion, and
the homage of men of the first station, while it
perhaps injured her reputation as woman, added
to her celebrity as fine lady. So much do we
cold English, prudes though we be, forgive to
the foreigner what we avenge on the native.</p>

<p>Sliding at last from these general topics into
very well-bred and elegant personal compliment,
and reciting various eulogies, which Lord this
the Duke of that had passed on the Marchesa's
charms, Randal laid his hand on hers, with the
license of admitted friendship, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But since you have deigned to confide in me,
since when (happily for me, and with a generosity
of which no coquette could have been capable)
you, in good time, repressed into friendship
feelings that might else have ripened into those
you are formed to inspire and disdain to return,
you told me with your charming smile, 'Let no
one speak to me of love who does not offer me
his hand, and with it the means to supply tastes
that I fear are terribly extravagant;' since thus
you allowed me to divine your natural objects,
and upon that understanding our intimacy has
been founded, you will pardon me for saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that the admiration you excite among the <i>grands
seigneurs</i> I have named, only serves to defeat
your own purpose, and scare away admirers
less brilliant, but more in earnest. Most of
these gentlemen are unfortunately married; and
they who are not belong to those members of
our aristocracy who, in marriage, seek more
than beauty and wit&mdash;namely, connections to
strengthen their political station, or wealth to
redeem a mortgage and sustain a title."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Leslie," replied the Marchesa&mdash;and
a certain sadness might be detected in the
tone of the voice and the droop of the eye&mdash;"I
have lived long enough in the real world to appreciate
the baseness and the falsehood of most
of those sentiments which take the noblest names.
I see through the hearts of the admirers you parade
before me, and know that not one of them
would shelter with his ermine the woman to
whom he talks of his heart. Ah," continued
Beatrice, with a softness of which she was unconscious,
but which might have been extremely
dangerous to youth less steeled and self-guarded
than was Randal Leslie's&mdash;"ah, I am less
ambitious than you suppose. I have dreamed
of a friend, a companion, a protector, with feelings
still fresh, undebased by the low round of
vulgar dissipation and mean pleasures&mdash;of a
heart so new, that it might restore my own to
what it was in its happy spring. I have seen in
your country some marriages, the mere contemplation
of which has filled my eyes with delicious
tears. I have learned in England to
know the value of home. And with such a heart
as I describe, and such a home, I could forget
that I ever knew a less pure ambition."</p>

<p>"This language does not surprise me," said
Randal; "yet it does not harmonize with your
former answer to me."</p>

<p>"To you," repeated Beatrice, smiling, and
regaining her lighter manner; "to you&mdash;true.
But I never had the vanity to think that your
affection for me could bear the sacrifices it would
cost you in marriage; that you, with your ambition,
could bound your dreams of happiness to
home. And then, too," said she, raising her
head, and with a certain grave pride in her air&mdash;"and
<i>then</i>, I could not have consented to
share my fate with one whom my poverty would
cripple. I could not listen to my heart, if it had
beat for a lover without fortune, for to him I
could then have brought but a burden, and betrayed
him into a union with poverty and debt.
<i>Now</i>, it may be different. Now I may have the
dowry that befits my birth. And now I may be
free to choose according to my heart as woman,
not according to my necessities, as one poor,
harassed, and despairing."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Randal, interested, and drawing
still closer toward his fair companion&mdash;"ah, I
congratulate you sincerely; you have cause,
then, to think that you shall be&mdash;rich?"</p>

<p>The Marchesa paused before she answered,
and during that pause Randal relaxed the web
of the scheme which he had been secretly weaving,
and rapidly considered whether, if Beatrice
di Negra would indeed be rich, she might answer
to himself as a wife; and in what way, if
so, he had best change his tone from that of
friendship into that of love. While thus reflecting,
Beatrice answered:</p>

<p>"Not rich for an Englishwoman; for an Italian,
yes. My fortune should be half a million&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Half a million!" cried Randal, and with
difficulty he restrained himself from falling at
her feet in adoration.</p>

<p>"Of francs!" continued the Marchesa.</p>

<p>"Francs! Ah," said Randal, with a long-drawn
breath, and recovering from his sudden
enthusiasm, "about twenty thousand pounds!&mdash;eight
hundred a year at four per cent. A
very handsome portion, certainly&mdash;(Genteel poverty!
he murmured to himself. What an escape
I have had! but I see&mdash;I see. This will
smooth all difficulties in the way of my better
and earlier project. I see)&mdash;a very handsome
portion," he repeated aloud&mdash;"not for a <i>grand
seigneur</i>, indeed, but still for a gentleman of
birth and expectations worthy of your choice, if
ambition be not your first object. Ah, while
you spoke with such endearing eloquence of
feelings that were fresh, of a heart that was new,
of the happy English home, you might guess
that my thoughts ran to my friend who loves
you so devotedly, and who so realizes your ideal.
Providentially, with us, happy marriages and
happy homes are found not in the gay circles of
London fashion, but at the hearths of our rural
nobility&mdash;our untitled country gentlemen. And
who, among all your adorers, can offer you a lot
so really enviable as the one whom, I see by
your blush, you already guess that I refer to?"</p>

<p>"Did I blush?" said the Marchesa, with a
silvery laugh. "Nay, I think that your zeal for
your friend misled you. But I will own frankly,
I have been touched by his honest, ingenuous
love&mdash;so evident, yet rather looked than spoken.
I have contrasted the love that honors me, with
the suitors that seek to degrade; more I can
not say. For though I grant that your friend is
handsome, high-spirited, and generous, still he
is not what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mistake, believe me," interrupted Randal.
"You shall not finish your sentence. He
<i>is</i> all that you do not yet suppose him; for his
shyness, and his very love, his very respect
for your superiority, do not allow his mind and
his nature to appear to advantage. You, it is
true, have a taste for letters and poetry rare
among your countrywomen. He has not at
present&mdash;few men have. But what Cimon would
not be refined by so fair an Iphigenia? Such frivolities
as he now shows belong but to youth and inexperience
of life. Happy the brother who could
see his sister the wife of Frank Hazeldean."</p>

<p>The Marchesa bent her cheek on her hand in
silence. To her, marriage was more than it
usually seems to dreaming maiden or to disconsolate
widow. So had the strong desire to escape
from the control of her unprincipled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
remorseless brother grown a part of her very
soul&mdash;so had whatever was best and highest in
her very mixed and complex character been
galled and outraged by her friendless and exposed
position, the equivocal worship rendered
to her beauty, the various debasements to which
pecuniary embarrassments had subjected her&mdash;not
without design on the part of the Count, who
though grasping, was not miserly, and who by
precarious and seemingly capricious gifts at one
time, and refusals of all aid at another, had involved
her in debt in order to retain his hold on
her&mdash;so utterly painful and humiliating to a woman
of her pride and her birth was the station
that she held in the world&mdash;that in marriage she
saw liberty, life, honor, self-redemption; and
these thoughts while they compelled her to co-operate
with the schemes by which the Count,
on securing to himself a bride, was to bestow on
herself a dower, also disposed her now to receive
with favor Randal Leslie's pleadings on behalf
of his friend.</p>

<p>The advocate saw that he had made an impression,
and with the marvelous skill which his
knowledge of those natures that engaged his study
bestowed on his intelligence, he continued to improve
his cause by such representations as were
likely to be most effective. With what admirable
tact he avoided panegyric of Frank as the mere
individual, and drew him rather as the type, the
ideal of what a woman in Beatrice's position
might desire in the safety, peace, and honor of a
home, in the trust and constancy, and honest confiding
love of its partner! He did not paint an
elysium; he described a haven; he did not glowingly
delineate a hero of romance&mdash;he soberly
portrayed that representative of the Respectable
and the Real which a woman turns to when romance
begins to seem to her but delusion. Verily,
if you could have looked into the heart of the person
he addressed, and heard him speak, you
would have cried admiringly, "Knowledge <i>is</i>
power; and this man, if as able on a larger field
of action, should play no mean part in the history
of his time."</p>

<p>Slowly Beatrice roused herself from the reveries
which crept over her as he spoke&mdash;slowly,
and with a deep sigh, and said,</p>

<p>"Well, well, grant all you say; at least before
I can listen to so honorable a love, I must be relieved
from the base and sordid pressure that
weighs on me. I can not say to the man who
wooes me, 'Will you pay the debts of the daughter
of Franzini, and the widow of di Negra?'"</p>

<p>"Nay, your debts, surely, make so slight a
portion of your dowry."</p>

<p>"But the dowry has to be secured;" and here,
turning the tables upon her companion, as the
apt proverb expresses it, Madame di Negra extended
her hand to Randal, and said in her most
winning accents, "You are, then, truly and sincerely
my friend?"</p>

<p>"Can you doubt it?"</p>

<p>"I prove that I do not, for I ask your assistance."</p>

<p>"Mine? How?"</p>

<p>"Listen; my brother has arrived in London&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see that arrival announced in the papers."</p>

<p>"And he comes, empowered by the consent
of the Emperor, to ask the hand of a relation
and countrywoman of his; an alliance that will
heal long family dissensions, and add to his own
fortunes those of an heiress. My brother, like
myself, has been extravagant. The dowry which
by law he still owes me it would distress him to
pay till this marriage be assured."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Randal. "But how can
I aid this marriage?"</p>

<p>"By assisting us to discover the bride. She,
with her father, sought refuge and concealment
in England."</p>

<p>"The father had, then, taken part in some
political disaffections, and was proscribed?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so; and so well has he concealed
himself that he has baffled all our efforts to discover
his retreat. My brother can obtain him
his pardon in cementing this alliance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Proceed."</p>

<p>"Ah, Randal, Randal, is this the frankness of
friendship? You know that I have before sought
to obtain the secret of our relation's retreat&mdash;sought
in vain to obtain it from Mr. Egerton
who assuredly knows it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who communicates no secrets to living
man," said Randal, almost bitterly; "who, close
and compact as iron, is as little malleable to me
as to you."</p>

<p>"Pardon me. I know you so well that I believe
you could attain to any secret you sought
earnestly to acquire. Nay, more, I believe that
you know already that secret which I ask you to
share with me."</p>

<p>"What on earth makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"When, some weeks ago, you asked me to
describe the personal appearance and manners
of the exile, which I did partly from the recollections
of my childhood, partly from the description
given to me by others, I could not but notice
your countenance, and remark its change; in
spite," said the Marchesa, smiling and watching
Randal while she spoke&mdash;"in spite of your habitual
self-command. And when I pressed you
to own that you had actually seen some one who
tallied with that description, your denial did not
deceive me. Still more, when returning recently,
of your own accord, to the subject, you questioned
me so shrewdly as to my motives in seeking
the clew to our refugees, and I did not then
answer you satisfactorily, I could detect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," interrupted Randal, with the low
soft laugh by which occasionally he infringed
upon Lord Chesterfield's recommendation to shun
a merriment so natural as to be ill-bred&mdash;"ha,
ha, you have the fault of all observers too minute
and refined. But even granting that I may have
seen some Italian exiles (which is likely enough),
what could be more simple than my seeking to
compare your description with their appearance;
and granting that I might suspect some one
among them to be the man you search for, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
more simple, also, than that I should desire to
know if you meant him harm or good in discovering
his 'whereabout?' For ill," added Randal,
with an air of prudery, "ill would it become
me to betray, even to friendship, the retreat of
one who would hide from persecution; and even
if I did so&mdash;for honor itself is a weak safeguard
against your fascinations&mdash;such indiscretion
might be fatal to my future career."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Do you not say that Egerton knows the
secret, yet will not communicate?&mdash;and is he a
man who would ever forgive in me an imprudence
that committed himself? My dear friend,
I will tell you more. When Audley Egerton
first noticed my growing intimacy with you, he
said, with his usual dryness of counsel, 'Randal,
I do not ask you to discontinue acquaintance with
Madame di Negra&mdash;for an acquaintance with
women like her, forms the manners and refines
the intellect; but charming women are dangerous,
and Madame di Negra is&mdash;a charming woman.'"</p>

<p>The Marchesa's face flushed. Randal resumed:
"'Your fair acquaintance' (I am still
quoting Egerton) 'seeks to discover the home
of a countryman of hers. She suspects that I
know it. She may try to learn it through you.
Accident may possibly give you the information
she requires. Beware how you betray it. By
one such weakness I should judge of your general
character. He from whom a woman can
extract a secret will never be fit for public life.'
Therefore, my dear Marchesa, even supposing
I possess this secret, you would be no true friend
of mine to ask me to reveal what would emperil
all my prospects. For as yet," added Randal,
with a gloomy shade on his brow&mdash;"as yet I do
not stand alone and erect&mdash;I <i>lean</i>; I am dependent."</p>

<p>"There may be a way," replied Madame di
Negra, persisting, "to communicate this intelligence,
without the possibility of Mr. Egerton's
tracing our discovery to yourself; and, though I
will not press you further, I add this&mdash;You urge
me to accept your friend's hand; you seem interested
in the success of his suit, and you plead
it with a warmth that shows how much you regard
what you suppose is his happiness; I will
never accept his hand till I can do so without
blush for my penury&mdash;till my dowry is secured,
and that can only be by my brother's union with
the exile's daughter. For your friend's sake,
therefore, think well how you can aid me in the
first step to that alliance. The young lady once
discovered, and my brother has no fear for the
success of his suit."</p>

<p>"And you would marry Frank, if the dower
was secured?"</p>

<p>"Your arguments in his favor seem irresistible,"
replied Beatrice, looking down.</p>

<p>A flash went from Randal's eyes, and he mused
a few moments.</p>

<p>Then slowly rising, and drawing on his gloves,
he said,</p>

<p>"Well, at least you so far reconcile my honor
toward aiding your research, that you now inform
me you mean no ill to the exile."</p>

<p>"Ill!&mdash;the restoration to fortune, honors, his
native land."</p>

<p>"And you so far enlist my heart on your side,
that you inspire me with the hope to contribute
to the happiness of two friends whom I dearly
love. I will, therefore, diligently seek to ascertain
if, among the refugees I have met with,
lurk those whom you seek; and if so, I will
thoughtfully consider how to give you the clew.
Meanwhile, not one incautious word to Egerton."</p>

<p>"Trust me&mdash;I am a woman of the world."</p>

<p>Randal now had gained the door. He paused,
and renewed carelessly,</p>

<p>"This young lady must be heiress to great
wealth, to induce a man of your brother's rank
to take so much pains to discover her."</p>

<p>"Her wealth <i>will</i> be vast," replied the Marchesa;
"and if any thing from wealth or influence
in a foreign state could be permitted to
prove my brother's gratitude&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, fie," interrupted Randal, and approaching
Madame di Negra, he lifted her hand to his
lips, and said gallantly,</p>

<p>"This is reward enough to your <i>preux chevalier</i>."</p>

<p>With those words he took his leave.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>With his hands behind him, and his head
drooping on his breast&mdash;slow, stealthy, noiseless,
Randal Leslie glided along the streets on leaving
the Italian's house. Across the scheme he had
before revolved, there glanced another yet more
glittering, for its gain might be more sure and
immediate. If the exile's daughter were heiress
to such wealth, might he himself hope&mdash;. He
stopped short even in his own soliloquy, and his
breath came quick. Now, in his last visit to
Hazeldean, he had come in contact with Riccabocca,
and been struck by the beauty of Violante.
A vague suspicion had crossed him that these
might be the persons of whom the Marchesa was
in search, and the suspicion had been confirmed
by Beatrice's description of the refugee she desired
to discover. But as he had not then learned
the reason for her inquiries, nor conceived
the possibility that he could have any personal
interest in ascertaining the truth, he had only
classed the secret in question among those the
further research into which might be left to time
and occasion. Certainly the reader will not do
the unscrupulous intellect of Randal Leslie the
injustice to suppose that he was deterred from
confiding to his fair friend all that he knew of
Riccabocca, by the refinement of honor to which
he had so chivalrously alluded. He had correctly
stated Audley Egerton's warning against any
indiscreet confidence, though he had forborne to
mention a more recent and direct renewal of the
same caution. His first visit to Hazeldean had
been paid without consulting Egerton. He had
been passing some days at his father's house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
and had gone over thence to the Squire's. On
his return to London, he had, however, mentioned
this visit to Audley, who had seemed annoyed
and even displeased at it, though Randal well
knew sufficient of Egerton's character to know
that such feeling could scarce be occasioned
merely by his estrangement from his half brother.
This dissatisfaction had, therefore, puzzled the
young man. But as it was necessary to his views
to establish intimacy with the Squire, he did not
yield the point with his customary deference to
his patron's whims. He, therefore, observed that
he should be very sorry to do any thing displeasing
to his benefactor, but that his father had
been naturally anxious that he should not appear
positively to slight the friendly overtures of Mr.
Hazeldean.</p>

<p>"Why naturally?" asked Egerton.</p>

<p>"Because you know that Mr. Hazeldean is a
relation of mine&mdash;that my grandmother was a
Hazeldean."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Egerton, who, as it has been before
said, knew little, and cared less, about the
Hazeldean pedigree, "I was either not aware
of that circumstance, or had forgotten it. And
your father thinks that the Squire may leave you
a legacy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, my father is not so mercenary&mdash;such
an idea never entered his head. But the Squire
himself has indeed said, 'Why, if any thing happened
to Frank, you would be next heir to my
lands, and therefore we ought to know each other.'
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough," interrupted Egerton, "I am the
last man to pretend to the right of standing between
you and a single chance of fortune, or of
aid to it. And whom did you meet at Hazeldean?"</p>

<p>"There was no one there, sir; not even
Frank."</p>

<p>"Hum. Is the Squire not on good terms with
his parson? Any quarrel about tithes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no quarrel. I forgot Mr. Dale; I saw
him pretty often. He admires and praises you
very much, sir."</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;and why? What did he say of me?"</p>

<p>"That your heart was as sound as your head;
that he had once seen you about some old parishioners
of his; and that he had been much impressed
with a depth of feeling he could not
have anticipated in a man of the world, and a
statesman."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was all; some affair when I was
member for Lansmere?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>Here the conversation was broken off; but the
next time Randal was led to visit the Squire he
had formally asked Egerton's consent, who, after
a moment's hesitation, had as formally replied,
"I have no objection."</p>

<p>On returning from this visit, Randal mentioned
that he had seen Riccabocca; and Egerton, a
little startled at first, said composedly, "Doubtless
one of the political refugees; take care not
to set Madame di Negra on his track. Remember,
she is suspected of being a spy of the Austrian
government."</p>

<p>"Rely on me, sir," said Randal; "but I should
think this poor Doctor can scarcely be the person
she seeks to discover?"</p>

<p>"That is no affair of ours," answered Egerton;
"we are English gentlemen, and make not
a step toward the secrets of another."</p>

<p>Now, when Randal revolved this rather ambiguous
answer, and recalled the uneasiness with
which Egerton had first heard of his visit to Hazeldean,
he thought that he was indeed near the
secret which Egerton desired to conceal from
him and from all&mdash;viz., the incognito of the Italian
whom Lord L'Estrange had taken under his
protection.</p>

<p>"My cards," said Randal to himself, as, with
a deep-drawn sigh, he resumed his soliloquy,
"are becoming difficult to play. On the one hand,
to entangle Frank into marriage with this foreigner,
the Squire would never forgive him. On
the other hand, if she will not marry him without
the dowry&mdash;and that depends on her brother's
wedding this countrywoman&mdash;and that countrywoman
be, as I surmise, Violante&mdash;and Violante
be this heiress, and to be won by me! Tush,
tush. Such delicate scruples in a woman so
placed and so constituted as Beatrice di Negra,
must be easily talked away. Nay, the loss itself
of this alliance to her brother, the loss of her
own dowry&mdash;the very pressure of poverty and
debt&mdash;would compel her into the sole escape left
to her option. I will then follow up the old plan;
I will go down to Hazeldean, and see if there be
any substance in the new one; and then to reconcile
both&mdash;aha&mdash;the House of Leslie shall rise
yet from its ruin&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he was startled from his reverie by a
friendly slap on the shoulder, and an exclamation&mdash;"Why,
Randal, you are more absent than
when you used to steal away from the cricket-ground,
muttering Greek verses at Eton."</p>

<p>"My dear Frank," said Randal, "you&mdash;you
are so <i>brusque</i>, and I was just thinking of you."</p>

<p>"Were you? And kindly, then, I am sure,"
said Frank Hazeldean, his honest, handsome face
lighted up with the unsuspecting genial trust of
friendship; "and heaven knows," he added, with
a sadder voice, and a graver expression on his
eye and lip&mdash;"Heaven knows I want all the kindness
you can give me!"</p>

<p>"I thought," said Randal, "that your father's
last supply, of which I was fortunate enough to
be the bearer, would clear off your more pressing
debts. I don't pretend to preach, but really
I must say once more, you should not be so extravagant."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> (seriously).&mdash;"I have done my best
to reform. I have sold off my horses, and I have
not touched dice nor card these six months; I
would not even put into the raffle for the last
Derby." This last was said with the air of a
man who doubted the possibility of obtaining belief
to some assertion of preternatural abstinence
and virtue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal</span>.&mdash;"Is it possible? But, with such
self-conquest, how is it that you can not contrive
to live within the bounds of a very liberal allowance?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> (despondingly).&mdash;"Why, when a man
once gets his head under water, it is so hard
to float back again on the surface. You see, I
attribute all my embarrassments to that first
concealment of my debts from my father, when
they could have been so easily met, and when
he came up to town so kindly."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, then, that I gave you that advice."</p>

<p>"Oh, you meant it so kindly, I don't reproach
you; it was all my own fault."</p>

<p>"Why, indeed, I did urge you to pay off that
moiety of your debts left unpaid, with your allowance.
Had you done so, all had been well."</p>

<p>"Yes, but poor Borrowwell got into such a
scrape at Goodwood; I could not resist him&mdash;a
debt of honor, <i>that</i> must be paid; so when I
signed another bill for him, he could not pay it,
poor fellow: really he would have shot himself,
if I had not renewed it; and now it is swelled to
such an amount with that cursed interest, that
<i>he</i> never can pay it; and one bill, of course, begets
another, and to be renewed every three
months; 'tis the devil and all! So little as I
ever got for all I have borrowed," added Frank
with a kind of rueful amaze. "Not &pound;1500 ready
money; and it would cost me almost as much
yearly&mdash;if I had it."</p>

<p>"Only &pound;1500."</p>

<p>"Well, besides seven large chests of the worst
cigars you ever smoked; three pipes of wine
that no one would drink, and a great bear, that
had been imported from Greenland for the sake
of its grease."</p>

<p>"That should at least have saved you a bill
with your hairdresser."</p>

<p>"I paid his bill with it," said Frank, "and
very good-natured he was to take the monster
off my hands; it had already hugged two soldiers
and one groom into the shape of a flounder. I
tell you what," resumed Frank, after a short
pause, "I have a great mind even now to tell
my father honestly all my embarrassments."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal</span> (solemnly).&mdash;"Hum!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>.&mdash;"What? don't you think it would
be the best way? I never can save enough&mdash;never
can pay off what I owe; and it rolls like
a snowball."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Randal</span>.&mdash;"Judging by the Squire's talk, I
think that with the first sight of your affairs you
would forfeit his favor forever; and your mother
would be so shocked, especially after supposing
that the sum I brought you so lately sufficed to
pay off every claim on you. If you had not assured
her of that, it might be different; but she
who so hates an untruth, and who said to the
Squire, 'Frank says this will clear him; and
with all his faults, Frank never yet told a lie.'"</p>

<p>"Oh my dear mother!&mdash;I fancy I hear her!"
cried Frank with deep emotion. "But I did
not tell a lie, Randal; I did not say that that
sum would clear me."</p>

<p>"You empowered and begged me to say so,"
replied Randal, with grave coldness; "and don't
blame me if I believed you."</p>

<p>"No, no! I only said it would clear me for
the moment."</p>

<p>"I misunderstood you, then, sadly; and such
mistakes involve my own honor. Pardon me,
Frank; don't ask my aid in future. You see,
with the best intentions I only compromise myself."</p>

<p>"If you forsake me, I may as well go and
throw myself into the river," said Frank in a
tone of despair; "and sooner or later my father
must know my necessities. The Jews threaten
to go to him already; and the longer the delay,
the more terrible the explanation."</p>

<p>"I don't see why your father should ever learn
the state of your affairs; and it seems to me
that you could pay off these usurers, and get rid
of these bills, by raising money on comparatively
easy terms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How?" cried Frank eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, the Casino property is entailed on you,
and you might obtain a sum upon that, not to be
paid till the property becomes yours."</p>

<p>"At my poor father's death? Oh, no&mdash;no!
I can not bear the idea of this cold-blooded calculation
on a father's death. I know it is not
uncommon; I know other fellows who have
done it, but they never had parents so kind as
mine; and even in them it shocked and revolted
me. The contemplating a father's death and
profiting by the contemplation&mdash;it seems a kind
of parricide&mdash;it is not natural, Randal. Besides,
don't you remember what the governor said&mdash;he
actually wept while he said it, 'Never calculate
on my death; I could not bear that.' Oh, Randal,
don't speak of it!"</p>

<p>"I respect your sentiments; but still all the
post-obits you could raise could not shorten Mr.
Hazeldean's life by a day. However, dismiss
that idea; we must think of some other device.
Ha, Frank! you are a handsome fellow, and
your expectations are great&mdash;why don't you
marry some woman with money?"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" exclaimed Frank, coloring. "You
know, Randal, that there is but one woman in
the world I can ever think of, and I love her so
devotedly, that, though I was as gay as most
men before, I really feel as if the rest of her sex
had lost every charm. I was passing through
the street now&mdash;merely to look up at her windows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You speak of Madame di Negra? I have
just left her. Certainly she is two or three
years older than you; but if you can get over
that misfortune, why not marry her?"</p>

<p>"Marry her!" cried Frank in amaze, and all
his color fled from his cheeks. "Marry her!&mdash;are
you serious?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"But even if she, who is so accomplished, so
admired&mdash;even if she would accept me, she is,
you know, poorer than myself. She has told me
so frankly. That woman has such a noble heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and&mdash;and&mdash;my father would never consent, nor
my mother either. I know they would not."</p>

<p>"Because she is a foreigner?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;partly."</p>

<p>"Yet the Squire suffered his cousin to marry
a foreigner."</p>

<p>"That was different. He had no control over
Jemima; and a daughter-in-law is so different;
and my father is so English in his notions; and
Madame di Negra, you see, is altogether so
foreign. Her very graces would be against her
in his eyes."</p>

<p>"I think you do both your parents injustice.
A foreigner of low birth&mdash;an actress or singer,
for instance&mdash;of course would be highly objectionable;
but a woman, like Madame di Negra, of
such high birth and connections&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head. "I don't think the
governor would care a straw about her connections,
if she were a king's daughter. He considers
all foreigners pretty much alike. And
then, you know"&mdash;Frank's voice sank into a
whisper&mdash;"you know that one of the very reasons
why she is so dear to me would be an insuperable
objection to the old-fashioned folks at
home."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, Frank."</p>

<p>"I love her the more," said young Hazeldean,
raising his front with a noble pride, that seemed
to speak of his descent from a race of cavaliers
and gentlemen&mdash;"I love her the more because
the world has slandered her name&mdash;because I
believe her to be pure and wronged. But would
they at the Hall&mdash;they who do not see with a
lover's eyes&mdash;they who have all the stubborn
English notions about the indecorum and license
of Continental manners, and will so readily
credit the worst? O, no&mdash;I love&mdash;I can not
help it&mdash;but I have no hope."</p>

<p>"It is very possible that you may be right,"
exclaimed Randal, as if struck and half-convinced
by his companion's argument&mdash;"very possible;
and certainly I think that the homely folks at
the Hall would fret and fume at first, if they
heard you were married to Madame di Negra.
Yet still, when your father learned that you had
done so, not from passion alone, but to save him
from all pecuniary sacrifice&mdash;to clear yourself
of debt&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" exclaimed Frank impatiently.</p>

<p>"I have reason to know that Madame di
Negra will have as large a portion as your
father could reasonably expect you to receive
with any English wife. And when this is properly
stated to the Squire, and the high position
and rank of your wife fully established and
brought home to him&mdash;for I must think that
these would tell, despite your exaggerated notions
of his prejudices&mdash;and then, when he really
sees Madame di Negra, and can judge of her
beauty and rare gifts, upon my word, I think,
Frank, that there would be no cause for fear.
After all, too, you are his only son. He will
have no option but to forgive you; and I know
how anxiously both your parents wish to see you
settled in life."</p>

<p>Frank's whole countenance became illuminated.
"There is no one who understands the
Squire like you, certainly," said he, with lively
joy. "He has the highest opinion of your judgment.
And you really believe you could smooth
matters?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, but I should be sorry to induce
you to run any risk; and if, on cool consideration,
you think that risk is incurred, I strongly
advise you to avoid all occasion of seeing the
poor Marchesa. Ah, you wince; but I say it
for her sake as well as your own. First, you
must be aware, that, unless you have serious
thoughts of marriage, your attentions can but
add to the very rumors that, equally groundless,
you so feelingly resent; and, secondly, because
I don't think any man has a right to win the
affections of a woman&mdash;especially a woman who
seems likely to love with her whole heart and
soul&mdash;merely to gratify his own vanity."</p>

<p>"Vanity! Good heavens, can you think so
poorly of me? But as to the Marchesa's affections,"
continued Frank, with a faltering voice,
"do you really and honestly believe that they
are to be won by me?"</p>

<p>"I fear lest they may be half won already,"
said Randal, with a smile and a shake of the
head; "but she is too proud to let you see any
effect you may produce on her, especially when,
as I take it for granted, you have never hinted
at the hope of obtaining her hand."</p>

<p>"I never till now conceived such a hope. My
dear Randal, all my cares have vanished&mdash;I
tread upon air&mdash;I have a great mind to call on
her at once."</p>

<p>"Stay, stay," said Randal. "Let me give
you a caution. I have just informed you that
Madame di Negra will have, what you suspected
not before, a fortune suitable to her birth;
any abrupt change in your manner at present
might induce her to believe that you were influenced
by that intelligence."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Frank, stopping short, as
if wounded to the quick. "And I feel guilty&mdash;feel
as if I <i>was</i> influenced by that intelligence.
So I am, too, when I reflect," he continued, with
a <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> that was half pathetic; "but I hope
she will not be so <i>very</i> rich&mdash;if so, I'll not call."</p>

<p>"Make your mind easy, it is but a portion of
some twenty or thirty thousand pounds, that
would just suffice to discharge all your debts,
clear away all obstacles to your union, and in return
for which you could secure a more than
adequate jointure and settlement on the Casino
property. Now I am on that head, I will be yet
more communicative. Madame di Negra has a
noble heart, as you say, and told me herself, that,
until her brother on his arrival had assured her
of this dowry, she would never have consented
to marry you&mdash;never cripple with her own embarrassments
the man she loves. Ah! with
what delight she will hail the thought of assisting
you to win back your father's heart! But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
be guarded, meanwhile. And now, Frank,
what say you&mdash;would it not be well if I run
down to Hazeldean to sound your parents? It
is rather inconvenient to me, to be sure, to leave
town just at present; but I would do more than
that to render you a smaller service. Yes, I'll
go to Rood Hall to-morrow, and thence to
Hazeldean. I am sure your father will press me
to stay, and I shall have ample opportunities to
judge of the manner in which he would be likely
to regard your marriage with Madame di Negra&mdash;supposing
always it were properly put to him.
We can then act accordingly."</p>

<p>"My dear, dear Randal. How can I thank
you? If ever a poor fellow like me can serve
you in return&mdash;but that's impossible."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, I will never ask you to be
security to a bill of mine," said Randal, laughing.
"I practice the economy I preach."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Frank with a groan, "that is because
your mind is cultivated&mdash;you have so many
resources; and all my faults have come from
idleness. If I had any thing to do on a rainy
day, I should never have got into these scrapes."</p>

<p>"Oh! you will have enough to do some day
managing your property. We who have no
property must find one in knowledge. Adieu,
my dear Frank; I must go home now. By the
way, you have never, by chance, spoken of the
Riccaboccas to Madame di Negra?"</p>

<p>"The Riccaboccas? No. That's well thought
of. It may interest her to know that a relation
of mine has married her countryman. Very odd
that I never did mention it; but, to say truth, I
really do talk so little to her; she is so superior,
and I feel positively shy with her."</p>

<p>"Do me the favor, Frank," said Randal, waiting
patiently till this reply ended&mdash;for he was
devising all the time what reason to give for his
request&mdash;"never to allude to the Riccaboccas
either to her or to her brother, to whom you are
sure to be presented."</p>

<p>"Why not allude to them?"</p>

<p>Randal hesitated a moment. His invention
was still at fault, and, for a wonder, he thought
it the best policy to go pretty near the truth.</p>

<p>"Why, I will tell you. The Marchesa conceals
nothing from her brother, and he is one of
the few Italians who are in high favor with the
Austrian court."</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"And I suspect that poor Dr. Riccabocca fled
his country from some mad experiment at revolution,
and is still hiding from the Austrian police."</p>

<p>"But they can't hurt him here," said Frank,
with an Englishman's dogged inborn conviction
of the sanctity of his native island. "I should
like to see an Austrian pretend to dictate to us
whom to receive and whom to reject."</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;that's true and constitutional, no
doubt; but Riccabocca may have excellent
reasons&mdash;and, to speak plainly, I know he has,
(perhaps as affecting the safety of friends in
Italy)&mdash;for preserving his incognito, and we are
bound to respect those reasons without inquiring
further."</p>

<p>"Still, I can not think so meanly of Madame
di Negra," persisted Frank (shrewd here, though
credulous elsewhere, and both from his sense of
honor), "as to suppose that she would descend
to be a spy, and injure a poor countryman of her
own, who trusts to the same hospitality she receives
herself at our English hands. Oh, if I
thought that, I could not love her!" added Frank,
with energy.</p>

<p>"Certainly you are right. But see in what a
false position you would place both her brother
and herself. If they knew Riccabocca's secret,
and proclaimed it to the Austrian government,
as you say, it would be cruel and mean; but if
they knew it and concealed it, it might involve
them both in the most serious consequences.
You know the Austrian policy is proverbially so
jealous and tyrannical?"</p>

<p>"Well, the newspapers say so, certainly."</p>

<p>"And, in short, your discretion can do no harm,
and your indiscretion may. Therefore, give me
your word, Frank. I can't stay to argue now."</p>

<p>"I'll not allude to the Riccaboccas, upon my
honor," answered Frank; "still I am sure they
would be as safe with the Marchesa as with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I rely on your honor," interrupted Randal,
hastily, and hurried off.</p>


<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>


<p>Toward the evening of the following day,
Randal Leslie walked slowly from a village on
the main road (about two miles from Rood Hall),
at which he had got out of the coach. He passed
through meads and corn-fields, and by the skirts
of woods which had formerly belonged to his
ancestors, but had long since been alienated.
He was alone amidst the haunts of his boyhood,
the scenes in which he had first invoked the
grand Spirit of Knowledge, to bid the Celestial
Still One minister to the commands of an earthly
and turbulent ambition. He paused often in
his path, especially when the undulations of the
ground gave a glimpse of the gray church tower,
or the gloomy firs that rose above the desolate
wastes of Rood.</p>

<p>"Here," thought Randal, with a softening eye&mdash;"here,
how often, comparing the fertility of
the lands passed away from the inheritance of
my fathers, with the forlorn wilds that are left
to their mouldering hall&mdash;here, how often have I
said to myself&mdash;'I will rebuild the fortunes of my
house.' And straightway Toil lost its aspect of
drudge, and grew kingly, and books became as
living armies to serve my thought. Again&mdash;again&mdash;O
thou haughty Past, brace and strengthen
me in the battle with the Future." His pale
lips writhed as he soliloquized, for his conscience
spoke to him while he thus addressed his will, and
its voice was heard more audibly in the quiet of
the rural landscape, than amid the turmoil and din
of that armed and sleepless camp which we call
a city.</p>

<p>Doubtless, though Ambition have objects more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
vast and beneficent than the restoration of a name&mdash;<i>that</i>
in itself is high and chivalrous, and appeals
to a strong interest in the human heart. But all
emotions, and all ends, of a nobler character, had
seemed to filter themselves free from every golden
grain in passing through the mechanism of Randal's
intellect, and came forth at last into egotism
clear and unalloyed. Nevertheless, it is a strange
truth that, to a man of cultivated mind, however
perverted and vicious, there are vouchsafed
gleams of brighter sentiments, irregular perceptions
of moral beauty, denied to the brutal unreasoning
wickedness of uneducated villainy&mdash;which
perhaps ultimately serve as his punishment&mdash;according
to the old thought of the satirist, that
there is no greater curse than to perceive virtue,
yet adopt vice. And as the solitary schemer
walked slowly on, and his childhood&mdash;innocent at
least of deed&mdash;came distinct before him through
the halo of bygone dreams&mdash;dreams far purer than
those from which he now rose each morning to the
active world of Man&mdash;a profound melancholy
crept over him, and suddenly he exclaimed aloud,
"<i>Then</i> I aspired to be renowned and great&mdash;<i>now</i>,
how is it that, so advanced in my career, all that
seemed lofty in the means has vanished from me,
and the only means that I contemplate are those
which my childhood would have called poor and
vile? Ah! is it that I then read but books, and
now my knowledge has passed onward, and men
contaminate more than books? But," he continued
in a lower voice, as if arguing with himself,
"if power is only so to be won&mdash;and of what use
is knowledge if it be not power&mdash;does not success
in life justify all things? And who prizes the wise
man if he fails?" He continued his way, but still
the soft tranquillity around rebuked him, and still
his reason was dissatisfied, as well as his conscience.
There are times when Nature, like a
bath of youth, seems to restore to the jaded soul
its freshness&mdash;times from which some men have
emerged, as if reborn. The crises of life are
very silent. Suddenly the scene opened on Randal
Leslie's eyes. The bare desert common&mdash;the
dilapidated church&mdash;the old house, partially
seen in the dank dreary hollow, into which it
seemed to Randal to have sunken deeper and
lowlier than when he saw it last. And on the
common were some young men playing at hockey.
That old-fashioned game, now very uncommon
in England, except at schools, was still preserved
in the primitive simplicity of Rood by the
young yeomen and farmers. Randal stood by the
stile and looked on, for among the players he
recognized his brother Oliver. Presently the
ball was struck toward Oliver, and the group instantly
gathered round that young gentleman, and
snatched him from Randal's eye; but the elder
brother heard a displeasing din, a derisive laughter.
Oliver had shrunk from the danger of the
thick clubbed sticks that plied around him, and
received some strokes across the legs, for his
voice rose whining, and was drowned by shouts
of, "Go to your mammy. That's Noll Leslie&mdash;all
over. Butter shins."</p>

<p>Randal's sallow face became scarlet. "The
jest of boors&mdash;a Leslie!" he muttered, and
ground his teeth. He sprang over the stile, and
walked erect and haughtily across the ground.
The players cried out indignantly. Randal raised
his hat, and they recognized him, and stopped the
game. For him at least a certain respect was
felt. Oliver turned round quickly, and ran up to
him. Randal caught his arm firmly, and, without
saying a word to the rest, drew him away
toward the house. Oliver cast a regretful, lingering
look behind him, rubbed his shins, and then
stole a timid glance toward Randal's severe and
moody countenance.</p>

<p>"You are not angry that I was playing at
hockey with our neighbors," said he deprecatingly,
observing that Randal would not break the
silence.</p>

<p>"No," replied the elder brother; "but, in associating
with his inferiors, a gentleman still
knows how to maintain his dignity. There is no
harm in playing with inferiors, but it is necessary
to a gentleman to play so that he is not the laughing-stock
of clowns."</p>

<p>Oliver hung his head, and made no answer.
They came into the slovenly precincts of the
court, and the pigs stared at them from the palings
as they had stared years before, at Frank
Hazeldean.</p>

<p>Mr. Leslie senior, in a shabby straw hat, was
engaged in feeding the chickens before the threshold,
and he performed even that occupation with
a maundering lackadaisical slothfulness, dropping
down the grains almost one by one from his
inert dreamy fingers.</p>

<p>Randal's sister, her hair still and forever hanging
about her ears, was seated on a rush-bottom
chair, reading a tattered novel; and from the
parlor window was heard the querulous voice of
Mrs. Leslie, in high fidget and complaint.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, as the young heir to all this
helpless poverty stood in the court-yard, with
his sharp, refined, intelligent features, and his
strange elegance of dress and aspect, one better
comprehended how, left solely to the egotism of
his knowledge and his ambition, in such a family,
and without any of the sweet nameless lessons
of Home, he had grown up into such close
and secret solitude of soul&mdash;how the mind had
taken so little nutriment from the heart, and how
that affection and respect which the warm circle
of the hearth usually calls forth had passed
with him to the graves of dead fathers, growing,
as it were, bloodless and ghoul-like amid the
charnels on which they fed.</p>

<p>"Ha, Randal, boy," said Mr. Leslie, looking
up lazily, "how d'ye do? Who could have expected
you? My dear&mdash;my dear," he cried, in
a broken voice, and as if in helpless dismay,
"here's Randal, and he'll be wanting dinner, or
supper, or something." But in the mean while,
Randal's sister Juliet had sprung up and thrown
her arms round her brother's neck, and he had
drawn her aside caressingly, for Randal's strongest
human affection was for this sister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are growing very pretty, Juliet," said
he, smoothing back her hair; "why do yourself
such injustice&mdash;why not pay more attention to
your appearance, as I have so often begged you
to do?"</p>

<p>"I did not expect you, dear Randal; you always
come so suddenly, and catch us <i>en dish-a-bill</i>."</p>

<p>"Dish-a-bill!" echoed Randal, with a groan.&mdash;"<i>Dishabille!</i>&mdash;you
ought never to be so
caught!"</p>

<p>"No one else does so catch us&mdash;nobody else
ever comes! Heigho," and the young lady sighed
very heartily.</p>

<p>"Patience, patience; my day is coming, and
then yours, my sister," replied Randal with genuine
pity, as he gazed upon what a little care
could have trained into so fair a flower, and what
now looked so like a weed.</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Leslie, in a state of intense excitement&mdash;having
rushed through the parlor&mdash;leaving
a fragment of her gown between the yawning
brass of the never-mended Brummagem
work-table&mdash;tore across the hall&mdash;whirled out of
the door, scattering the chickens to the right and
left, and clutched hold of Randal in her motherly
embrace. "La, how you do shake my nerves,"
she cried, after giving him a most hearty and
uncomfortable kiss. "And you are hungry, too,
and nothing in the house but cold mutton! Jenny,
Jenny, I say Jenny! Juliet, have you seen
Jenny? Where's Jenny? Out with the old
man, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"I am not hungry, mother," said Randal; "I
wish for nothing but tea." Juliet, scrambling
up her hair, darted into the house to prepare the
tea, and also to "tidy herself." She dearly loved
her fine brother, but she was greatly in awe of
him.</p>

<p>Randal seated himself on the broken pales.
"Take care they don't come down," said Mr.
Leslie, with some anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I am very light; nothing comes
down with me."</p>

<p>The pigs stared up, and grunted in amaze at
the stranger.</p>

<p>"Mother," said the young man, detaining Mrs.
Leslie, who wanted to set off in chase of Jenny&mdash;"mother,
you should not let Oliver associate
with those village boors. It is time to think of
a profession for him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he eats us out of house and home&mdash;such
an appetite! But as to a profession&mdash;what is he
fit for! He will never be a scholar."</p>

<p>Randal nodded a moody assent; for, indeed,
Oliver had been sent to Cambridge, and supported
there out of Randal's income from his official
pay;&mdash;and Oliver had been plucked for his Little
Go.</p>

<p>"There is the army," said the elder brother&mdash;"a
gentleman's calling. How handsome Juliet
ought to be&mdash;but&mdash;I left money for masters&mdash;and
she pronounces French like a chambermaid."</p>

<p>"Yet she is fond of her book too. She's always
reading, and good for nothing else."</p>

<p>"Reading!&mdash;those trashy novels!"</p>

<p>"So like you&mdash;you always come to scold, and
make things unpleasant," said Mrs. Leslie, peevishly.
"You are grown too fine for us, and I
am sure we suffer affronts enough from others,
not to want a little respect from our own children."</p>

<p>"I did not mean to affront you," said Randal,
sadly. "Pardon me. But who else has done
so?"</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Leslie went into a minute and most
irritating catalogue of all the mortifications and
insults she had received; the grievances of a
petty provincial family, with much pretension
and small power; of all people, indeed, without
the disposition to please&mdash;without the ability to
serve&mdash;who exaggerate every offense, and are
thankful for no kindness. Farmer Jones had
insolently refused to send his wagon twenty
miles for coals. Mr. Giles, the butcher, requesting
the payment of his bill, had stated that
the custom at Rood was too small for him to
allow credit. Squire Thornhill, who was the
present owner of the fairest slice of the old Leslie
domains, had taken the liberty to ask permission
to shoot over Mr. Leslie's land, since
Mr. Leslie did not preserve. Lady Spratt (new
people from the city, who hired a neighboring
country seat) had taken a discharged servant of
Mrs. Leslie's without applying for the character.
The Lord Lieutenant had given a ball, and had
not invited the Leslies. Mr. Leslie's tenants
had voted against their landlord's wish at the
recent election. More than all, Squire Hazeldean
and his Harry had called at Rood, and
though Mrs. Leslie had screamed out to Jenny,
"Not at home," she had been seen at the window,
and the Squire had actually forced his way
in, and caught the whole family "in a state not
fit to be seen." That was a trifle, but the
Squire had presumed to instruct Mr. Leslie how
to manage his property, and Mrs. Hazeldean
had actually told Juliet to hold up her head and
tie up her hair, "as if we were her cottagers!"
said Mrs. Leslie, with the pride of a Montfydget.</p>

<p>All these and various other annoyances, though
Randal was too sensible not to perceive their insignificance,
still galled and mortified the listening
heir of Rood. They showed, at least, even
to the well-meant officiousness of the Hazeldeans,
the small account in which the fallen family was
held. As he sat still on the moss-grown pale,
gloomy and taciturn, his mother standing beside
him, with her cap awry, Mr. Leslie shamblingly
sauntered up and said, in a pensive, dolorous
whine&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish we had a good sum of money, Randal,
boy!"</p>

<p>To do Mr. Leslie justice, he seldom gave vent
to any wish that savored of avarice. His mind
must be singularly aroused, to wander out of
its normal limits of sluggish, dull content.</p>

<p>So Randal looked at him in surprise, and said,
"Do you, sir?&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"The manors of Rood and Dulmansberry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
all the lands therein, which my great-grandfather
sold away, are to be sold again when Squire
Thornhill's eldest son comes of age, to cut off
the entail. Sir John Spratt talks of buying
them. I should like to have them back again!
'Tis a shame to see the Leslie estates hawked
about, and bought by Spratts and people.
I wish I had a great&mdash;great sum of ready
money."</p>

<p>The poor gentleman extended his helpless
fingers as he spoke, and fell into a dejected
reverie.</p>

<p>Randal sprang from the paling, a movement
which frightened the contemplative pigs, and
set them off squalling and scampering. "When
does young Thornhill come of age?"</p>

<p>"He was nineteen last August. I know it,
because the day he was born I picked up my
fossil of the sea-horse, just by Dulmansberry
church, when the joy-bells were ringing. My
fossil sea-horse? It will be an heirloom, Randal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two years&mdash;nearly two years&mdash;yet&mdash;ah,
ah!" said Randal; and his sister now appearing
to announce that tea was ready, he threw his
arm round her neck and kissed her. Juliet had
arranged her hair and trimmed up her dress.
She looked very pretty, and she had now the air
of a gentlewoman&mdash;something of Randal's own
refinement in her slender proportions and well-shaped
head.</p>

<p>"Be patient, patient still, my dear sister,"
whispered Randal, "and keep your heart whole
for two years longer."</p>

<p>The young man was gay and good-humored
over his simple meal, while his family grouped
round him. When it was over, Mr. Leslie lighted
his pipe, and called for his brandy-and-water.
Mrs. Leslie began to question about London and
Court, and the new King and the new Queen,
and Mr. Audley Egerton, and hoped Mr. Egerton
would leave Randal all his money, and that
Randal would marry a rich woman, and that
the King would make him a prime-minister one
of these days; and then she would like to see if
Farmer Jones would refuse to send his wagon
for coals! And every now and then, as the word
"riches" or "money" caught Mr. Leslie's ear,
he shook his head, drew his pipe from his mouth,
and muttered, "A Spratt should not have what
belonged to my great-great-grandfather, if I had
a good sum of ready money!&mdash;the old family
estates!" Oliver and Juliet sate silent, and on
their good-behavior; and Randal, indulging his
own reveries, dreamily heard the words "money,"
"Spratt," "great-great-grandfather," "rich
wife," "family estates;" and they sounded to
him vague and afar off, like whispers from the
world of romance and legend&mdash;weird prophecies
of things to be.</p>

<p>Such was the hearth which warmed the viper
that nestled and gnawed at the heart of Randal,
poisoned all the aspirations that youth should
have rendered pure, ambition lofty, and knowledge
beneficent and divine.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>When the rest of the household were in deep
sleep, Randal stood long at his open window,
looking over the dreary, comfortless scene&mdash;the
moon gleaming from skies half-autumnal,
half-wintry, upon squalid decay, through the
ragged fissures of the firs; and when he lay
down to rest, his sleep was feverish, and troubled
by turbulent dreams.</p>

<p>However, he was up early, and with an unwonted
color in his cheeks, which his sister
ascribed to the country air. After breakfast,
he took his way toward Hazeldean, mounted
upon a tolerable horse, which he hired of a
neighboring farmer who occasionally hunted.
Before noon, the garden and terrace of the Casino
came in sight. He reined in his horse, and
by the little fountain at which Leonard had been
wont to eat his radishes and con his book, he saw
Riccabocca seated under the shade of the red
umbrella. And by the Italian's side stood a form
that a Greek of old might have deemed the Naiad
of the Fount; for in its youthful beauty there was
something so full of poetry&mdash;something at once
so sweet and so stately&mdash;that it spoke to the imagination
while it charmed the sense.</p>

<p>Randal dismounted, tied his horse to the gate,
and, walking down a trellised alley, came suddenly
to the spot. His dark shadow fell over the
clear mirror of the fountain just as Riccabocca
had said, "All here is so secure from evil!&mdash;the
waves of the fountain are never troubled like those
of the river!" and Violante had answered in her
soft native tongue, and lifting her dark, spiritual
eyes&mdash;"But the fountain would be but a lifeless
pool, oh, my father, if the spray did not mount
toward the skies!"</p>

<h4>(TO BE CONTINUED.)</h4>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Another" id="Another"></a>YOU'RE ANOTHER!</h2>


<p>"You're another!" It's a vulgar retort, but
a common one&mdash;though not much in use
among well-bred people. But there are many
ways of saying it&mdash;various modes of conveying
the same meaning. "<i>Et tu Brute</i>," observed
some one, on reading a debate in the House of
Commons; "I often see these words quoted;
what can they mean?" "I should say," was
the answer, "they mean, 'Oh, you brute!'"
"Well, I rather think they mean '<i>You're another!</i>'"
Let the classicist determine which interpretation
is the right one.</p>

<p>"You're another!" may be conveyed in a mild
tone and manner. For instance:&mdash;"The right
honorable gentleman seems not to apprehend the
points of the argument: he says he does not understand
how so and so is so and so. We can
only supply him with arguments level to the
meanest capacity, not with brains. Nature having
been sparing in her endowments to the honorable
gentleman, must be matter of deep regret
to those who are under the painful necessity of
listening to the oft-times-refuted assertions and
so-called arguments which he has advanced upon
this very question."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The honorable gentleman, thus delicately alluded
to, replies, "My honorable and learned
friend (if he will permit me to call him so) complains
that his arguments are not understood;
the simple reason being that they are unintelligible.
He calls them arguments level to the meanest
capacity, and let me assure him they are
level to the meanest capacity only, for they are
his own. Let me hasten to relieve his anxiety
as to the remarks which I have felt it my duty
to make upon the question under discussion, by
assuring him that they have been understood by
those who have intelligence to appreciate them,
though I am not prepared to vouch as much for
my honorable and learned friend on the other
side of the House." Thus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each lolls the tongue out at the other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shakes his empty noddle at his brother.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One honorable member accuses another of stating
that which is the "reverse of true"&mdash;the other
responds by a charge of "gross misrepresentation
of the facts of the case." Coalheavers would
use a shorter and more emphatic word to express
the same thing, though it would neither be classical
nor conformable to the rules of the House.
The Frenchman delicately defined a white lie
to be "valking round about de trooth." We
know what honorable members mean when they
talk in the above guise. It is, "You're another!"</p>

<p>Dr. Whiston accuses the Chapter of Rochester
with applying for their own purposes the funds
bequeathed by pious men of former times for the
education of the poor. The reply of the Chapter
is&mdash;"You Atheist!" and they deprive the
doctor of his living. Sir Samuel Romilly once
proposed to alter the law of bankruptcy, and to
make freehold estates assets appropriable for
debts, like personal property. The existing law
he held to be pregnant with dishonesty and fraud
against creditors. Mr. Canning immediately was
down upon him with the "You're another" argument.
"Dishonesty!" he said, "why, this
proposal is neither more nor less than a dangerous
and most dishonest attack upon the
aristocracy, and the beginning of something
which may end, if carried, like the French Revolution."</p>

<p>Worthy men are often found differing about
some speculative point, respecting which neither
can have any more certain knowledge than the
other, and they wax fierce and bitter, each devoting
the other to a fate which we dare not
venture to describe. One calls the other "bigot,"
who retorts by calling out "idolater," or perhaps
"fanatic;" and the phrases are bandied
about with the gusto and fervor of Billingsgate&mdash;the
meaning of the whole is, "You're
another!"</p>

<p>Literary men have frequently ventured into
this bandying about of strange talk. Rival country
editors have sometimes been great adepts in
it; though the fashion is gradually going out of
date. There is nothing like the bitterness of
criticism now, which used to prevail some fifty
years ago. Godwin mildly assailed Southey as
a renegade, in return for which Southey abused
Godwin's abominably ugly nose. Moore spoke
slightingly of Leigh Hunt's Cockney poetry, and
Leigh Hunt in reply ridiculed Moore's diminutive
figure. Southey cut up Byron in the Reviews,
and Byron cut up Southey in the Vision
of Judgment. Scott did not appreciate Coleridge,
and Coleridge spoke of Ivanhoe and The
Bride of Lammermoor as "those wretched abortions."</p>

<p>You often hear of talkers who are "good at a
retort." It means they can say "You're another!"
in a biting, clever way. The wit of
many men is of this kind&mdash;cutting and sarcastic.
Nicknames grow out of it&mdash;the Christian calls
the Turk an Infidel&mdash;as the Turk calls the Christian
a Dog of an Unbeliever. Whig and Tory retort
on each other the charge of oppressor. "The
priest calls the lawyer a cheat, the lawyer beknaves
the divine." It all means "You're another!"
Phrenologists say the propensity arises
in the organ of combativeness. However that
may be, there is need of an abatement. Retort,
even the most delicately put, is indignation, and
indignation is the handsome brother of hatred.
It breeds bitterness between man and man, and
produces nothing but evil. The practice is only
a modification of Billingsgate, cover it with what
elegant device we may. In any guise the
"You're another" style of speech ought to be
deprecated and discountenanced.</p>

<h2>Monthly Record of Current Events.</h2>


<h4>UNITED STATES.</h4>

<p>The political events of the month just closed have
been of considerable interest. November is the
month for elections in several of the most important
States: the interest which usually belongs to these
events is enhanced in this instance by the fact that
they precede a Presidential contest, which occurs
next year, and they are scanned, therefore, with the
more care as indicative of its results. In several of
the States, however, the elections of this year do not
afford any substantial ground for predicting their votes
in the Presidential election, as questions were at issue
now which may not greatly influence them then.
In <span class="smcap">Georgia</span>, for example the old political parties
were wholly broken up, and the divisions which they
occasion did not prevail. Both the candidates for
Governor were prominent members of the Democratic
party; but Hon. <span class="smcap">Howell Cobb</span>, Speaker of
the last House of Representatives in Congress, was
put forward as the Union candidate, while Mr.
<span class="smcap">McDonald</span>, his opponent, was the candidate of those
who were in favor of seceding from the Union, on
account of the Compromise measures of 1850. The
same division prevailed in the Congressional contest,
the nominees being Unionists and Secessionists,
without regard to other distinctions. The general
result was announced in our November Record. The
Union party elected <i>six</i> out of the <i>eight</i> members of
Congress, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Cobb</span> was elected Governor by a
very large majority. The following is a statement
of the vote in each of the Congressional districts,
upon both tickets; and gives an accurate view of
the sentiments of the people of the State upon that
subject:</p>

<p>This shows a popular majority of over eighteen
thousand in favor of the Union. The election of
Members of the Legislature took place at the same
time, and resulted in the choice to the Senate of
<i>thirty-nine</i> Union and <i>eight</i> Secession Senators, and
to the House of <i>one hundred and one</i> Union, and
<i>twenty-six</i> Southern-rights men. Upon the Legislature
thus chosen will devolve the duty of electing a
Senator in the Congress of the United States, in place
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Berrien</span>, whose term expires next spring.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">South Carolina</span> an election has taken place
for members of Congress and delegates to a State
Convention, in which the same issue superseded all
others. One party avowed itself in favor of the
immediate and separate secession of the State from
the Union, while the other was in favor of awaiting
the co-operation of other Southern States. Both held
that the action of the Federal Government had been
hostile to Southern interests and rights, and both
professed to be in favor of taking measures of redress.
They differed, however, as to the means and
time of action, and the following table shows the
relative strength of each party in the State&mdash;those in
favor of the Union as it is, of course, voting with the
Co-operationists:</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Virginia</span> the election was for members of Congress,
and upon the adoption of the new Constitution.
The result has been that the Congressional delegation
stands as before, and the new Constitution was adopted
by a very large majority. Among the Whig members
defeated was Hon. John Minor Botts, who has
since written a letter attributing his defeat to the
stand which he took in Convention in favor of a
mixed basis of representation. The new Constitution
adopts the principle of universal suffrage in all
elections, limited, however, to white male citizens
who are twenty-one years of age, and who have resided
two years in the State and one year in the
county in which they vote. Persons in the naval or
military service of the United States are not to be
deemed residents in the State by reason of being
stationed therein. No person will have the right to
vote who is of unsound mind, or a pauper, or a non-commissioned
officer, soldier, seaman, or marine in
the service of the United States, or who has been
convicted of bribery in an election, or of any infamous
offense. In all elections votes are required to be
given openly <i>viva voce</i>, and not by ballot, except that
dumb persons entitled to suffrage may vote by ballot.
Under the new Constitution, the Governor, Lieutenant
Governor, and Attorney General are to be
elected by the people. These officers for the ensuing
term, as well as members of the Senate and
House of Representatives, are to be chosen on the
8th day of December next. The seats of all members
of the General Assembly already elected will be from
that date vacated by the effect of the new Constitution.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Pennsylvania</span> the election for Governor, Canal

<p>In the Legislature there are, Senators 16 Democrats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
16 Whigs, and one Native American; in the House
of Representatives, 54 Democrats and 46 Whigs.</p>

<p>Elections have also been held in Ohio, New York,
Wisconsin, Maryland, and Massachusetts; but up to
the time of closing this record, official returns
have not been received.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the return of the expedition
sent out by Mr. Henry Grinnell in search
of the great English navigator, Sir John Franklin,
and the general result of their Arctic explorations.
Surgeon <span class="smcap">E. K. Kane</span>, who accompanied the expedition,
has since published a letter, in which he expresses
the opinion that Sir John, while wintering in
the cove near Beechy's Island, where unmistakable
signs of his presence were discovered, found a path-way
made by the opening of the ice, toward the
north, and that he passed northward by Wellington
Channel and did not return. The American expedition
was caught in an ice drift nearly opposite the
spot of Franklin's first sojourn, and borne northward
in the ice for fifteen days. Into the region north and
west of Cornwallis Island, which is open sometimes
and may be always, a continuance of the drift a few
days longer would have borne the American Squadron:
and in that region Mr. Kane thinks Sir John
Franklin must now be sought. The chances of his
destruction by ice, or by want of food, he thinks, are
not great. The British residents of New York gave
Mr. Grinnell a public dinner on the 4th of November
at the Astor House, at which a large company sat
down, Mr. Anthony Barclay presiding. Great interest
continues to be felt in the search for Sir John Franklin,
and it is probable that it will be renewed in the
early spring. In the preceding pages of this Number
will be found an exceedingly interesting history of the
Expedition, from the journal of one of its members&mdash;accompanied
by numerous illustrations of the scenes
and incidents encountered during the voyage.</p>

<p>The case of Mr. John S. Thrasher, an American
gentleman resident at Havana, has excited a good
deal of public interest. Mr. T. has resided there for
a number of years. He was the editor and proprietor
of the <i>Faro Industrial</i>, a paper devoted entirely to
commercial matters, and which he had conducted
with energy, ability, and success. While the American
prisoners were in Havana, Mr. Thrasher took a
marked interest in them, and did all in his power to
alleviate the discomforts of their position. For some
reason, which has never yet been assigned, he incurred
the distrust of the authorities, and on the 1st
of September he was prohibited from issuing his paper
which was seized. Feeling confident that his
property would soon be restored, he devoted himself
to procure comforts for his countrymen who had been
condemned to transportation. The police, however,
were ordered strictly to watch his movements. His
letters were stopped, seized, and examined; but they
contained nothing to warrant proceedings against him.
On the arrival of the steamer <i>Georgia</i> from the United
States, two policemen followed him and saw him receive
letters from the clerk. They arrested him on
landing and searched his papers, but found nothing
but a business letter. For two or three days he continued
under arrest, when a letter was brought to
him sealed, directed to him, and said to have been
found upon his desk. It proved to be written in cipher,
but Mr. Thrasher declared himself ignorant
alike of its contents and its author. This, however,
was of no avail. He was immediately committed to
prison, and on the 25th of September was thrust into
a damp, dark dungeon, cut from the rock and level
with the sea, with a bare board for furniture, and
where death will be the inevitable consequence of a
few weeks' confinement. At the latest dates no
charges had been publicly made against him, his trial
had not taken place, and no one was admitted to see
him. The result of the affair is looked for with great
anxiety.</p>

<p>The late President <span class="smcap">Tyler</span> has written a letter to
the Spanish Minister in the United States, appealing
for the pardon and release of the Americans taken
prisoners in Cuba. He ventures to make the application
in view of the friendly relations which existed
between him and M. Calderon de la Barca during
his administration, and ventures to hope that his request
will be laid before the Queen of Spain. He
concedes the flagrancy of their offense, but urges that
sufficient punishment has already been inflicted, and
that their pardon will do much toward softening the
feelings of the people of this country toward the
Spanish government, and preventing future attempts
upon the peace of its colonies.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Wm. B. Campbell</span> was inaugurated Governor
of Tennessee on the 16th of October. His inaugural
address referred briefly to national affairs. He spoke
in the highest terms of commendation of those who
secured the passage of the Compromise bills, in the
Congress of 1850, and of the firm manner in which
they have been maintained by the President. The
disastrous results of secession were strongly depicted.
He urged that it must inevitably lead to bloody
civil wars, alike melancholy and deplorable for the
victors and the vanquished. He pledged himself to
maintain the Compromise measures, because he believed
their continuance on the statute book will promote
prosperity and happiness, while an interference
with them will inevitably produce agitation, mischief,
and misery.</p>

<p>A Convention of cotton planters was held at Macon,
Georgia, on the 28th of October. About three
hundred delegates were in attendance, of whom two
hundred came from half the counties in Georgia,
sixty-eight from one quarter of those of Alabama,
nineteen from five counties of Florida, and one or
two from each of several other Southern states. Ex-Governor
<span class="smcap">Moseley</span>, of Florida, was chosen President.
The object of the Convention was to render
the planters of cotton more independent of the ordinary
vicissitudes of trade, and to enable them to obtain more
uniformly high prices for their great staple.
A great variety of opinions prevailed upon the subject.
Various modes were suggested, but as none
seemed acceptable, the whole subject was referred to
a Committee of twenty-one, but even this Committee
could not agree. A proposition was then <i>rejected</i>, by
a vote of 48 to 43, which provided that planters should
make returns to a Central Committee to be established
of the cotton housed by the middle of January;
and further, that not more than two-thirds of the crop
should be sold before the 1st of May, and for not less
than eight cents a pound; and that the remaining
third should be sold at a time to be recommended by
the Central Committee. A minority report was presented
in favor of the Florida scheme for a Cotton
Planters' Association, with a capital of twenty millions
of dollars, and a warehouse for the storage of
cotton, whereby prices might be contracted. This
met the violent opposition of the Convention. Resolutions
were finally adopted recommending Central,
State, and County Associations to collect statistical
and general information respecting the production
and consumption of cotton. A committee was also
appointed to procure such legislative acts as may be
for the interest of planters. Resolutions were also
passed to encourage Southern manufacturers to employ
slave labor in their factories. Having urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
another Cotton Planters' Convention, and exhorted
delegates to arouse the public on the subject, by lectures
and otherwise, the assembly adjourned <i>sine die</i>,
after a session of several days, in which it will be
observed that very little business was transacted.</p>

<p>The magnetic telegraph has become so common an
agent of transmitting intelligence in this country, as
to render all news of its progress interesting and important.
Prof. <span class="smcap">Morse</span> has been for some time prosecuting
other persons for infringing his patent. A
rival line, using the machinery of Mr. <span class="smcap">Bain</span>, has
been for some years in operation between New York
and Philadelphia. A suit was commenced against
the Company and has been for some years pending in
the United States Circuit Court. It has just been
decided by Judge <span class="smcap">Kane</span>, in favor of the claimants
under Prof. Morse's patents. The several points
ruled by the Court in this case, are: 1. That an <i>art</i>
is the subject of a patent, as well as an implement
or a machine. 2. That an inventor may surrender and
obtain a re-issue of his patent more than once if necessary.
3. That Prof. Morse was the first inventor of
the art of recording signs at a distance by means of
electro-magnetism, or the magnetic telegraph. 4. That
the several parts or elements of the Morse
Telegraph are covered and protected by his patent,
as new inventions, and are really new, either as
single, independent inventions, or as parts of a new
combination for the purpose specified. 5. That the
patent granted to Prof. Morse for his "Local Circuit"
is valid, and that the "Branch Circuit" of the
Bain line is an infringement of it. 6. That the subject
and principles of the chemical telegraph are
clearly embraced in Morse's patents. These are the
chief questions in dispute. The counsel for the
complainants were directed to draw up a decree to
be made by the Court, in accordance with the prayer
of the bill and the decision just given. The case
will of course now be carried to the Supreme Court
of the United States.</p>

<p>In the New Monthly Magazine for July last (No.
14, Vol. III. p. 274) we gave a detailed statement of
the legal controversy between the Methodist Episcopal
Church South and the Methodist Episcopal
Church, brought by the former to recover a portion
of the "Book Fund." The suit came on May 19, in
the United States Circuit Court, and was elaborately
argued by distinguished counsel. The decision,
which was then deferred, was given by Judge <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>
on the 10th of November. It was long and
elaborate, going over the whole ground involved,
sketching the history of the case, and stating the
legal principles applicable to it. He decided that
the separation was legal, and that the Methodist
Episcopal Church South is entitled to a portion of
the Fund. This must end the controversy unless
an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court of
the United States.</p>

<p>A large number of the citizens of New York recently
addressed a letter to Hon. <span class="smcap">Henry Clay</span>, requesting
him to address a meeting in that city in
favor of the Compromise measures of 1850, expressing
a belief that additional exertions were needed to
prevent propositions for the repeal or modification
of some of the laws. Mr. Clay's reply, dated Oct. 3,
is long and elaborate. Declining the invitation, he
expresses great interest in the subject, and says he
believes that the great majority of the people in every
section of the Union, are satisfied with, or acquiesce
in, the compromise. The only law which encounters
any hostility, is that relating to the surrender of fugitive
slaves; and this is now almost universally
obeyed. Mr. Clay proceeds to urge the necessity
of such a law and its rigid execution; and he then
examines the principle of secession from the Union,
as it is presented and advocated in some of the
Southern States.</p>

<p>Rev. <span class="smcap">Archibald Alexander</span>, D. D., distinguished
as one of the oldest and ablest theologians in the
country, died at Princeton, N. J. on the 22d of October,
aged 81. He was a native of Virginia, and
became a minister in the Presbyterian Church at the
age of 21. He was early appointed President of
Hampton Sidney College. He afterward was called
to the Third Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia,
and was stationed, there, when in 1812, the Theological
Seminary was established at Princeton. He
was appointed the first Professor in that Seminary.</p>

<p>Dr. J. <span class="smcap">Kearney Rodgers</span>, distinguished in New
York as a surgeon, and of eminently useful and estimable
character, died on the 9th of November. Dr.
<span class="smcap">Granville Sharp Pattison</span>, also celebrated in
this country as well as in England for medical science
and practical skill, died on the 13th. He was distinguished
as an anatomist, and was the author of
several works upon medical subjects which enjoyed
a wide celebrity and are still used as standard
treatises.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gardner G. Howland</span>, well-known as one
of the oldest, most enterprising, and wealthiest merchants
of New York, and one of the most beneficent
and public spirited inhabitants of that city, died suddenly
on the 13th.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">California</span> our intelligence is to the 1st of
October. The State election had resulted in a Democratic
victory. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bigler</span>, the Democratic candidate, was
elected Governor by about 1500 majority;
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Marshall</span> and <span class="smcap">McCorkle</span>, Democrats, are
elected to Congress; and the Legislature, upon
which will devolve the duty of electing a U. S. Senator,
is strongly Democratic also.&mdash;&mdash;The Capital of
the State has been removed back from Vallejo to San
Jos&eacute;.&mdash;&mdash;The intelligence from the mines is highly
encouraging; new veins of gold are constantly discovered,
and the old placers have never been known
to yield more plentifully.&mdash;&mdash;The Indians in all the
northern sections of the country are represented as
being highly troublesome, and traveling there has become
dangerous.&mdash;&mdash;A large party of Mormons have
purchased the rancho of San Bernardino, near Los
Angelos; they gave $60,000 for it, and are to take
possession of it very soon.&mdash;&mdash;A railroad from San
Francisco to San Jos&eacute;, the first in California, has
been commenced.&mdash;&mdash;The Vigilance Committee at
San Francisco, has come to an end. Order and quiet
are completely restored, and a feeling of security is
rapidly gaining ground. The city is increasing very
fast both in population and in extent.&mdash;&mdash;Disastrous
news has been received from the American whaling
fleet in the North Pacific. Ten or twelve of the
ships have been lost: the season has been very
unprofitable for all.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Oregon</span>, we learn that emigrants were coming
in rapidly, though a late heavy snow-storm had
seriously retarded the progress of emigrants through
the mountains. The suffering from cold, and in some
instances from lack of provisions, has been very severe.&mdash;&mdash;The
Snake Indians are becoming hostile
and troublesome. Mr. Hudson Clark, from Illinois,
with his family, having got ahead of the train with
which he was traveling, was attacked by about thirty
Indians, near Raft River, and his mother and brother
were killed. Others had been killed a few days previously.
Outrages in different sections led to the belief
that the Indians were about to assume their
former attitude of hostility toward the inhabitants.&mdash;&mdash;Steps
have been taken by a Convention of Delegates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
from the country north of the Columbia River,
to form a new territorial government, or failing in
that, to organize a new State, and ask admission into
the Union. The reasons for this step are the great
extent of country, its distance from the Capital, and
the total absence of all municipal law and civil officers.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Sandwich Islands</span>, the volcanic Mountain
Maunaloa, had given tokens of an eruption early in
August. A letter in the <i>Polynesian</i> of the 12th says:
"The great crater of Maunaloa, that was generally
thought to be quite extinct, is now in action. For a
few days a heavy cloud, having the appearance of
smoke, has been observed to hover over the summit
of the mountain. Last night the mountain stood out
in bold relief, unobstructed by clouds or mist, and
presented a sublime and awfully grand appearance,
belching forth flames and cinders that again fell in
showers at a distance. The heavy bank of smoke
that lowered over its top, presented the appearance
of the mountain itself poised upon its apex. It is
possible that another eruption may take place like
that of 1843, and liquid lava be seen flowing down
its sides."</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">New Mexico</span> we have intelligence to the
last of October. Serious difficulties had occurred,
which excited deep hostility between the American
and Mexican portions of the population, and threatened
to inflict lasting injury upon the country. The
election for a Delegate to Congress, was held on the
1st of September. A number of Americans went to
the polls at Los Ranchos, for the purpose of voting,
but were refused by the Mexican authorities. Insisting
upon their right a general quarrel ensued.
The county judge, a Mexican named Ambrosio Armijo,
ordered out a number of armed men, who killed
an American named Edward Burtnett, stripping and
mangling his body. An investigation was held, but
without any important result. On the 23d, Mr. W.
C. Skinner, who had taken an active part in the effort
to bring the authors of this outrage to punishment,
was at Los Ranchos, and became involved in a dispute
with a Mexican, named Juan C. Armijo. As he
left him a number of Armijo's peons fell upon him
with clubs, and killed him on the spot. Mr. Skinner
was from Connecticut, and an active opponent of the
Governor in the Legislature of which he was a member.
Meetings of the Americans were held, at which
the conduct of the Mexicans was denounced, and the
attention of the General Government at Washington,
called to the condition of the territory.&mdash;&mdash;Major
Weightman has been elected Delegate to Congress:
loud complaints are made of frauds at the election.&mdash;&mdash;The
new military post in the Navajo country,
is at Ca&ntilde;on Bonito: Col. Summer and his command
were in pursuit of the Indians. Two soldiers who
had left Santa F&eacute; with the mail, for the Navajo
country, had not been heard from, and were supposed
to have been killed.&mdash;&mdash;Business was dull, and the
season very wet.</p>


<h4>SOUTH AMERICA.</h4>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Chili</span>, we have news of another insurrection.
The term of office of the late President, Gen.
<span class="smcap">Bulnes</span>, expired on the 16th of September. In August
the new election had taken place, and resulted
in the choice of Don <span class="smcap">Manuel Montt</span> over his opponent,
Gen. <span class="smcap">Cruz</span>. Montt was a successful lawyer of
Santiago, and had held a post in the cabinet of the
former administration. He was brought forward as
the candidate of the government, which rendered him
exceedingly obnoxious to the people. His opponent,
Gen. Cruz, had been one of the heroes of the revolution
and enjoyed great popularity with the army and
a large portion of the people, especially of the province
of Conception, of which he was the chief officer.
Fearing his influence then upon the election, the government
removed him, and this created great disaffection
among the people. Loud threats were heard,
that Montt, who had received a very large majority,
should not be inaugurated: the government, nevertheless,
steadily went on with their preparations for
that event. The revolt first broke out at Coquimbo,
on the 8th of September, where the disaffected party
deposed and banished the government officers, seized
the custom-house with about $70,000, and levied
forced loans from many of the wealthy inhabitants.
They then seized the steamer "Fire-fly," belonging
to an English gentleman, and sent her to Conception,
the stronghold of Gen. Cruz, to arouse his friends to
a similar movement there. An outbreak had already
taken place in that department; the insurgents had
been very successful&mdash;banished all the old officers,
and appointed new ones, and seized the Chilian mail
steamer, with $30,000 belonging to the government.
Up to this time, Gen. Cruz had kept himself aloof
from the movement, and had counseled his friends
against it. Feeling satisfied with their success, they
determined to await the action of the other provinces.
Meanwhile, the government having heard of the revolt,
and seeing that it was confined to these two departments,
took active measures for its suppression.
A detachment of infantry, consisting of 300 or 400
men, was sent to Valparaiso, but was induced to
march to join the insurgents in Coquimbo. Intelligence
of this defection created the most intense excitement
at the Capital, and the city was at once put
under martial-law, and a company of artillery was
sent against the deserters, who were all brought back
without bloodshed, within forty-eight hours. Their
leaders were thrown into prison, and would probably
be shot. Other troops were sent to the disaffected
region, and the few ships belonging to the Chilian
navy were sent to blockade the ports of Coquimbo
and Talcahuano. Meantime, the inauguration of
President Montt took place on the 18th of September,
the anniversary of Chilian independence, and
that day as well as the 17th, and 19th, were devoted
to magnificent festivities at Santiago. Gen. Bulnes
had left for Conception, to raise troops for the government
on the road, and put himself at their head.
There were rumors that he had been compelled to
fall back, and that Gen. Cruz had put himself at the
head of the movement in Conception. He had issued
a proclamation to the army, and authorized a steamer
to cruise in his service. At Coquimbo, Gen. Correa
was in command of the insurgent forces, and it was
reported that he had forced the government troops
under Gen. Guzman, to fall back. The British admiral,
on hearing of the seizure of the "Fire-fly"
steamer, had sent two steam-frigates to recover her
and demand indemnity. One of them, the <i>Gorgon</i>,
captured her at Coquimbo, and the commander had
entered into a convention with the party in power
there, agreeing to raise the blockade of that port, on
their agreeing to pay $30,000 indemnity to Mr. Lambert,
and $10,000 as ransom for the steamer, which
he had seized as a pirate, "provided the British admiral
should decide that he had a right to seize her."
Great dissatisfaction has been felt among the foreign
residents at the terms of this convention. Both the
British and American squadrons were watchfully
protecting the commerce of their respective countries.
The issue of the contest between the government
and the insurgents has not yet reached us, but
the latest advices state that the government felt confident
in its ability to repress the insurrection; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
strength and resources are shown by the fact that it
had remitted $80,000 to England, to meet dividends
and canal bonds.</p>

<p>We have further news of interest from Buenos
Ayres. Our intelligence of last month left Oribe,
with a large force, on the 30th of July, in daily expectation
of having a battle with the Brazilian troops
under Urquiza and Garzon&mdash;each contending for dominion
over Uruguay. The contest seems to have
been ended without a fight. As Oribe advanced
against the allied troops, he lost his men by desertion
in great numbers, and by the end of August six
thousand of his cavalry had joined the standard of
Urquiza, whose strength was rapidly increased. Finding
the force against him to be such as to forbid all
hope of a successful battle, Oribe seems to have abandoned
all hope. He had made up his mind to evacuate
the Oriental territory, and for that purpose had
requested the French admiral to convey him, with
the Argentine troops, to Buenos Ayres. This request
had been refused: and this refusal led to new
desertions from Oribe's force. Rosas was still in the
field, but would be compelled to surrender.</p>


<h4>MEXICO.</h4>

<p>We have intelligence from Mexico to the 15th of
October. The political condition of the country was
one of great embarrassment and peril. Dangers seem
to threaten the country from every quarter. On the
southern border is the danger growing out of the grant
to the United States of right of way across the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec. If the railroad is built there,
it is feared that the energy and business enterprise
which the Americans will infuse into that section of
the country, will gradually Americanize it, and thus
lead inevitably to its separation from Mexico. On
the other hand, if the grant is revoked, there is great
danger of war with the United States, which could
end only in renewed loss of territory. Upon the
northwest again, there is a prospect of invasion from
California. Thousands of the adventurous inhabitants
of that State are settling in the western section
of Mexico and preparing the way for its separation
from the central government.</p>

<p>A still more serious danger menaces them from
the Northern departments, in which, as was mentioned
in our last Number, a revolution has broken
out which promises to be entirely successful. Later
advices confirm this prospect. After taking Reynosa,
Gen. Caravajal, the leader of the revolution, marched
to Matamoras, which he reached on the 20th of
October, and forthwith attacked the place, which
had been prepared for an obstinate defense, under
Gen. Avalos. Several engagements between the opposing
forces had taken place, and the besieged army
is said to have lost two hundred men. The inhabitants
of Matamoras had been forced to leave, part
of the town had been twice on fire, and a great
amount of property was destroyed. But the city
still held out.</p>

<p>The general government had addressed a note,
through the Minister of War, under date of September
25, to the Governors of the Northern States, expressing
confidence in their fidelity and urging them
to spare no effort to crush the revolt. The Governors
had replied to the requisitions upon them for
troops, that their departments were not injured by
the revolution and that they would not aid its suppression.
This fact shows that the movement has
decided strength among the Mexicans themselves.</p>

<p>The Legislature of the State of Vera Cruz has
passed a resolution requesting Congress to charter
a railroad from Vera Cruz to Acapulco, by way of
Mexico. A good deal of hostility is evinced to a reported
design of the Pope to send a nuncio to the
capital.&mdash;The British Minister has demanded from
Mexico a judicial decree in favor of British creditors,
and has menaced the government with a blockade
of their ports as the alternative.&mdash;There had been a
military revolt of part of the troops in Yucatan, which
had been suppressed, and six of the soldiers shot.</p>

<p>The arrival of <span class="smcap">Kossuth</span> and the closing of the
Great Exhibition, are the two events by which the
month in England has been distinguished. The
great Hungarian received a very cordial welcome.
He came to Gibraltar from Constantinople by the
United States steam frigate Mississippi, which had
been sent out by the American government to convey
him to the United States. On reaching Marseilles
he proposed to go through France to England,
for the purpose of leaving his children there; and
then to meet the Mississippi again at Gibraltar.
The French government refused him permission to
pass through France. The receipt of this refusal
excited a good deal of feeling among the people of
Marseilles, who gathered in immense numbers to
testify their regard for the illustrious exile, and their
regret at the action of their government. In reply to
their manifestations, Kossuth addressed them a letter
of thanks, which was published in <i>Le Peuple</i> at
Marseilles. In this he merely alluded to the action
of the government and assured them that he did not
hold the French people responsible for it. He then
proceeded in the frigate to Gibraltar, where, after
staying two or three days, and receiving the utmost
civilities of the British officers there, he embarked
on board the British steamer Madrid, in which he
reached Southampton on the 23d of October. A
large concourse of people met him on the wharf and
escorted him, with great enthusiasm and hearty
cheering, to the residence of the mayor. In answer
to the loud cheers with which he was greeted, he
came out upon the balcony and briefly addressed the
crowd, warmly thanking them for their welcome and
expressing the profoundest gratitude to England for
the aid she had given to his deliverance from prison.&mdash;The
same day an address from the people of Southampton
was presented to him in the Town Hall, to
which he replied at some length. He spoke of the
feeling with which he had always studied the character
and institutions of England, and said that it
was her municipal institutions which had preserved
to Hungary some spirit of public life and constitutional
liberty, against the hostile acts of Austria.
The doctrine of centralization had been fatal to
France and other European nations. It was the foe
of liberty&mdash;the sure agent of absolute power. He
attributed much of England's freedom to her municipal
institutions. For himself, he regarded these
demonstrations of respect as paid to the political
principles he represented, rather than his person.
He believed that England would not allow Russia
to control the destinies of Europe&mdash;that her people
would not assist the ambition of a few families, but
the moral welfare and dignity of humanity. He
hoped to see some of those powerful associations of
English people, by which so much is done for political
rights, directing their attention, and extending
their powerful aid to Hungary. For himself life was
of no value, except as he could make use of it for
the liberty of his own country and the benefit of humanity.
He took the expression of respect by which
he had been met, as an encouragement to go on in
that way which he had taken for the aim of his life,
and which he hoped the blessings of the Almighty,
and the sympathy of the people of England and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
generous hearts all over the world, might help to
carry to a happy issue. It was a much greater merit
to acknowledge a principle in adversity than to pay
a tribute to its success. He thanked them for their
sympathy and assured them of the profound admiration
he had always entertained for the free institutions
of England.</p>

<p>On the 24th, <span class="smcap">Kossuth</span> went to the country house of
the mayor, and on the 25th attended a <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> at Winchester,
where he made a long speech, being mainly
an historical outline of the Hungarian revolution. He
explained the original character of Hungary, as a
constitutional monarchy, and its position between
Russia, Austria, and Turkey. Its constitution was
aristocratic, but its aristocracy was not rich, nor was
it opposed to the constitutional rights of the people.
Hungary had a parliament and county municipal institutions,
and to the latter he attributed the preservation
of the people's rights. All the orders of the
government to any municipal magistrate, must be
forwarded through county meetings, where they were
discussed, and sometimes withheld. They thus
formed a strong barrier against the encroachments
of the government; and no county needed such a
barrier more, for during more than three centuries,
the House of Hapsburg had not at its head a man
who was a friend to political freedom. The House
of Hapsburg ruled Hungary, but only according to
treaties&mdash;one of the conditions of which was, that they
were to rule the people of Hungary only through
Hungarian institutions, and according to its own
laws. Austria had succeeded in absorbing all the
other provinces connected with her&mdash;but her attempts
upon Hungary had proved unsuccessful. Her constant
efforts to subdue Hungary had convinced her
rulers that to the nobles alone her defense ought not
to be intrusted, but that all the people should have
an equal interest in their constitutional rights. This
was the direction of public opinion in Hungary in
1825. The first effort of the patriotic party, therefore,
was to emancipate the people&mdash;to relieve the
peasantry from their obligation to give 104 days out
of every year to their landlords, one-ninth of their
produce to their seigneur, and one-tenth to the bishop.
This was only effected by slow degrees. In the long
parliament, from 1832 to 1836, a measure was carried
giving the peasant the right to purchase exemption
from the duties with the consent of his landlord.
This, however, was vetoed by the Regent. The
government then set itself to work to corrupt the
county constituencies, by which members of the
Commons were chosen. They appointed officers to
be present at every meeting, and to control every
act. This system the liberal party resisted, because
they wished the county meetings to be free. And
this struggle went on until 1847, just before the
breaking out of the French Revolution. The revolution
in Vienna followed that event, and this threw
all power into the hands of Kossuth and his party.
He at once proposed to emancipate the peasantry,
and to indemnify the landlords from the land. The
measure was carried at once, through both Houses;
and Kossuth and his friends then went on, to give
to every inhabitant a right to vote, and to establish
representative institutions, including a responsible
ministry. The Emperor gave his sanction to all
these laws. Yet very soon after a rebellion was incited
by Austria among the Serbs, who resisted the
new Hungarian government, and declared their independence.
The Palatine, representing the King,
called for an army to put down the rebellion, and
Jellachich, who was its leader, was proclaimed a
traitor. But soon successes in Italy enabled the
Emperor to act more openly, and he recognized Jellachich
as his friend, and commissioned him to march
with an army against Hungary. He did so, but was
driven back. The Emperor then appointed him governor;
but the Hungarians would not receive him.
Then came an open war with Austria, in which the
Hungarians were successful. Reliable information
was then received that Russia was about to join
Austria in the war, and that Hungary had nowhere
to look for aid. It was then proposed that, if Hungary
was forced to contend against two mighty nations,
the reward of success should be its independence.
What followed, all know. He declared his
belief that, but for the treason of G&ouml;rgey, the Hungarians
could have defeated the united armies of their
foes. But the House of Hapsburg, as a dynasty, exists
no more. It merely vegetates at the whim of the
mighty Czar, to whom it has become the obedient
servant. But if England would only say that Russia
should not thus set her foot on the neck of Hungary,
all might yet be well. Hungary would have knowledge,
patriotism, loyalty, and courage enough to dispose
of its own domestic matters, as it is the sovereign
right of every nation to do. This was the cause for
which he asked the generous sympathy of the English
people; and he thanked them cordially for the
attention they had given to his remarks.</p>

<p>On the same occasion Mr. <span class="smcap">Cobden</span> spoke in favor
of the intervention of England to prevent Russia
from crushing Hungary, and obtaining control of
Europe, and Mr. J. R. <span class="smcap">Croskey</span>, the American
Consul at Southampton, expressed the opinion that
the time would come, if it had not already come,
when the United States would be forced into taking
more than an interest in European politics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kossuth</span> again addressed the company, thanking
them for the interest taken in the welfare of his
unhappy country, and expressing the hope that,
supported by this sympathy, the hopes expressed might
be realized at no distant day. He spoke also of the
different ways in which nations may promote the
happiness and welfare of their people. England, he
said, wants no change, because she is governed by a
constitutional monarchy, under which all classes in
the country enjoy the full benefits of free institutions.
The consequence is, the people of England are masters
of their own fates&mdash;defenders of her institutions&mdash;obedient
to the laws, and vigilant in their behavior&mdash;and
the country has become, and must forever
continue, under such institutions, to be great, glorious,
and free. Then the United States is a republic&mdash;and
though governed in a different way from
England, the people of the United States have no
motive for desiring a change&mdash;they have got liberty,
freedom, and every means for the full development
of their social condition and position. Under their
government, the people of the United States have,
in sixty years, arrived at a position of which they
may well be proud&mdash;and the English people, too,
have good reason to be proud of their descendants
and the share which she has had in the planting of
so great a nation on the other side of the Atlantic.
It was most gratifying to see so great and glorious a
nation thriving under a Constitution but little more
than sixty years old. It is not every republic in
which freedom is found to exist, and he said he could
cite examples in proof of his assertion&mdash;and he deeply
lamented that there is among them one great and
glorious nation where the people do not yet enjoy
that liberty which their noble minds so well fit them
for. It is not every monarchy that is good because
under it you enjoy full liberty and freedom. Therefore
he felt that it is not the living under a government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
called a republic, that will secure the liberties
of the people, but that quite as just and honest laws
may exist under a monarchy as under a republic. If
he wanted an illustration, he need only examine the
institutions of England and the United States, to
show that under different forms of government equal
liberty can and does exist. It was to increase the
liberties of the people that they had endeavored to
widen the basis on which their Constitution rested,
so as to include the whole population, and thus give
them an interest in the maintenance of social order.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Kossuth</span> had visited London privately, mainly
to consult a physician concerning his health, which
is delicate. He intended to remain in England until
the 14th of November, and then sail for New York in
one of the American steamers.</p>

<p>The Great Exhibition was closed Oct. 15 with
public ceremonies. The building was densely filled
with spectators, and there was a general attendance
of all who had been officially connected with the
Exhibition in any way. Viscount Canning read the
report of the Council of the Chairmen of Juries, rehearsing
the manner in which they had endeavored
to discharge the duties devolved upon them. There
had been thirty-four acting juries, composed equally
of British subjects and foreigners. The chairmen
of these juries were formed into a Council, to determine
the conditions upon which prizes should be
awarded, and to secure, so far as possible, uniformity
in the action of the juries. It was ultimately decided
that only two kinds of medals should be awarded,
one the <i>prize</i> medal, to be conferred wherever a certain
standard of excellence in production or workmanship
had been attained, and to be awarded by
the juries: the other the <i>council</i> medal, to be awarded
by the council, upon the recommendation of a jury,
for some important novelty of invention or application,
either in material or processes of manufacture,
or originality combined with great beauty of design.
The number of prize medals awarded was 2918: of
council medals 170. Honorable mention was made
of other exhibitors whose works did not entitle them
to medals. The whole number of exhibitors was
about 17,000. Prince <span class="smcap">Albert</span> responded to this
report, on behalf of the Royal Commissioners, thanking
the jurors and others for the care and assiduity
with which they had performed their duties, and
closing with the expression of the hope that the Exhibition
might prove to be a happy means of promoting
unity among nations, and peace and good
will among the various races of mankind. The
honor of knighthood has been conferred upon Mr.
Paxton, the designer of the building, Mr. Cubitt, the
engineer, and Mr. Fox, the contractor. The total
number of visits to the Exhibition has been 6,201,856:
466 schools and twenty-three parties of agricultural
laborers have visited it. The entire sum received
from the Exhibition has been &pound;505,107 5<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> of
which &pound;356,808 1<i>s.</i> was taken at the doors. About
&pound;90 of bad silver was taken&mdash;nearly all on the half-crown
and five shilling days. Of the 170 council
medals distributed 76 went to the United Kingdom,
57 to France, 7 to Prussia, 5 to the United States, 4
to Austria, 3 to Bavaria, 2 each to Belgium, Switzerland,
and Tuscany, 1 each to Holland, Russia, Rome,
Egypt, the East India Company, Spain, Tunis, and
Turkey, and one each to Prince Albert, Mr. Paxton,
Mr. Fox, and Mr. Cubitt.</p>

<p>The sum of &pound;758,196 from the British revenue for
the quarter ending October 11, is available toward
the payment of the national debt. The sum of
&pound;3,004,048 has been appropriated to that object
during the year.</p>

<p>The Queen returned on the 12th of October from
a protracted tour in Scotland. She visited Liverpool
and Manchester on her return, and in both cities
was received with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Serious difficulties have arisen in Ireland out of
the loans made by government to the various unions
for the relief. As the time for repaying these advances
comes round, the country is found to be unable
to pay the taxes levied for that purpose. These
rates run from five to ten shillings in the pound. In
some of the unions a disposition to repudiate the
debt has been shown&mdash;but this has generally proved
to be only a desire to postpone it until it can be done
without oppressively taxing the property. The question
has excited a great deal of feeling, and the difficulty
is not yet surmounted.</p>

<p>The public is anxiously awaiting the details of
Lord <span class="smcap">John Russell's</span> promised reform bill. It is of
course understood that its leading object will be to
extend the elective franchise, and the bare thought
of this has stimulated the organs of Toryism to prophetic
lamentations over the ruin which so radical a
movement will certainly bring upon the British Empire.</p>

<p>English colonial affairs engage a good deal of attention.
At the Cape of Good Hope the government
is engaged in a war with the native Kaffirs, which
does not make satisfactory progress. At the latest
accounts, coming down to September 12th, the hostile
natives continued to vex the frontiers, and Sir
Harry Smith, the military commandant, had found it
necessary to lead new forces against them. A severe
battle was fought on the 1st of September, and
repeated engagements had been had subsequently, in
all which great injury had been inflicted upon the
English troops. It was supposed that ten thousand
men would be required, in addition to the force already
there, to restore peace to the disaffected district.
The construction of a railway through Egypt, by
English capitalists, has met with serious obstacles
in the refusal of the Turkish Sultan to allow his
subject, the Pacha of Egypt, to treat with foreigners
for the purpose of allowing the work to go on. He
has, however, given the English to understand, that
he is not hostile to the railway, but is only unwilling
that it should become a pretext for making the
Pacha independent of him. Lord Palmerston acquiesces
in the justice of this view; and there will
probably be no difficulty in arranging the whole
matter.</p>


<h4>FRANCE.</h4>

<p>Political affairs in France have taken a remarkable
turn within the past month. The President
persisted in his determination to be a candidate for
re-election, and finding that he could not receive the
support of the majority as the government was constituted,
resolved upon a bold return to universal
suffrage. Having been elected to the Presidency by
universal suffrage, and finding that the restricted
suffrage would ruin him, he determined to repeal the
law of May, which disfranchised three millions of
voters, and throw himself again upon the whole people
of France. He accordingly demanded from his
Ministers their consent to the abrogation of that law.
They refused, and on the 14th of October all tendered
their resignation. They were at once accepted
by the President, but the Ministry were to retain
their places until a new one could be formed. This
proved to be a task of great difficulty. It was officially
announced that the President was preparing
his Message for the approaching session of the Assembly,
and that in this document he would, first,
lay down in very distinct terms, the abrogation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the law of May 31; secondly, that he will express
his irrevocable resolution to maintain the policy of
order, of conservation, and authority, and that he
would make no concession to anarchical ideas, under
whatever flag or name they may shelter themselves.</p>

<p>A new Ministry was definitively formed on the
27th of October, constituted as follows:</p>

</table></div>

<p>In several instances, within a few weeks past, the
Republican representatives in the various departments
of France, have been subjected to gross insults
from the police and other agents of the government.
M. Sartin, the representative for Allier, has
submitted a statement to the Assembly, saying that
while dining with a friend at Montlucon, two brigadiers
of gendarmerie entered and told the company
that, as the company exceeded fifteen, it was a political
meeting within the prohibition of the government.
M. Sartin produced his medal of representative
of the people, and claimed immunity. He was
told that no such immunity existed, except during
the session of the Assembly. Quite a scuffle ensued,
in which one or two persons were wounded. These
proceedings soon collected a crowd, and the people
declared that no more arrests should be made. Several
squadrons of cavalry soon arrived, and as the
result, thirteen persons were sent to prison.&mdash;In
Saucerre also, the magistrates having arrested three
persons, one of whom was the former mayor, the inhabitants
rose and attempted a rescue. The military
in the neighborhood collected and dispersed the
crowd, twenty-six of whom were arrested and committed
to prison.</p>


<h4>SOUTHERN EUROPE.</h4>

<p>There is no news of special interest from Southern
Europe. We have already noticed the letters of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> to Lord <span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>, exposing the
abominations of the Neapolitan government, in its
persecution of state prisoners&mdash;together with the official
reply which the King of Naples has caused to
be made to it. Lord Palmerston sent a copy of Mr.
Gladstone's letters to the British representatives at
each European Court, with instructions to lay them
before the Court to which he was accredited. The
Neapolitan Minister in London sent to Lord Palmerston
a book written in reply to Mr. Gladstone's letters,
by an English gentleman named M'Farlane,
and requested him to send this also to those British
representatives who had been furnished with the
other. Lord P. replied to this request in a spirited
letter, declaring his object to have been to arouse
the public sentiment of Europe against the cruelties
and outrageous violations of law and justice of which
the government of Naples is constantly guilty, and
saying that the King of Naples was very much mistaken,
if he believed public opinion could be controlled
or changed by such a pitiful diatribe as that
of Mr. M'Farlane. The only way of conciliating the
sentiment of Europe upon this subject, was by remedying
the evils which had excited its indignation.
The Courts of Germany, Austria, and Russia, to
which Mr. Gladstone's letters were sent, have complained
of this act as an unwarrantable interference,
on the part of Lord Palmerston, with the internal
administration of Naples. In the German Diet, at
Frankfort, Count Thun protested against the course
pursued by the British Minister, and maintained that
to criticise the criminal justice of other countries is
a most flagrant breach of the rights of nations. If
English statesmen could interfere with the conduct
of the King of Naples, for imprisoning men for supporting
the Constitution which he had sworn to
maintain, they might also interfere with the violations
of their oaths, as well as of justice, of which
the governments of Austria, Saxony, Baden, and
other countries had been guilty; and then, said he,
what was to become of kingly freedom and independence?
The Diet, on his motion, resolved to express
to the British Minister their astonishment at the
course the British government had pursued.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Prussia</span> vigorous preparations are made for
anticipated difficulties in France in the spring of
1852, after the Presidential election. The troops of
all the German states are to be put on a full war
establishment, and to be ready for immediate action
early in the spring. The western fortresses have
received orders to be in readiness for war.</p>

<p>A general Congress has been held of representatives
from the several German states, to make some
common arrangement for the management of the
electric telegraph. They have agreed that all messages
shall be forwarded without interruption, that a
common scale of charges shall be adopted, and that
the receipts shall go into a common fund, to be
distributed among the several states in proportion
to the number of miles of telegraphic communication
running through them.</p>

<p>The German Diet has resolved that the annexation
of the Prussian Polish provinces to the confederation
two years ago, was illegal and void. It has also determined
to take into consideration the claims of the
Ritter party in Hanover, to have the abolition of
their nobility privileges revoked. This abolition
was effected during the recent revolutions, but it
was done in a perfectly legal manner.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Austria, not long since, wrote a
letter to Prince Schwartzenberg, stating that the
Ministry would henceforth be responsible to him
alone, and that he would answer for the government.
This declaration, that the government was hereafter
to be absolute, excited deep feeling throughout the
country, and it was supposed that it might lead to a
political crisis. On the 11th of October, however,
the Ministers took the oath of obedience to the Emperor,
under this new definition of their powers and
responsibilities. The Emperor recently visited Lombardy,
where he had a very cold reception.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Spain</span> changes have been made in the administration
of the island of Cuba. A Colonial Council
has been created, which is to have charge of all
affairs relating to the colonial possessions, except
such as are specially directed by other Ministers. The
Captain-general of each colony is to conduct its affairs
under the direction of the Council. It is said
that the Spanish Government intends to relax its
customs regulations in favor of England.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">India</span> and the <span class="smcap">East</span> late intelligence has
been received. The Indian frontier continued
undisturbed: the troops suffered greatly from
sickness. There had been an outbreak in Malabar,
which caused great loss of life. The rebellion in
China still goes on, but details of its progress
are lacking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<h2>Editor's Table</h2>


<p>Time and Space&mdash;what are they? Do they
belong to the world without, or to the world
within, or to some mysterious and inseparable union
of both departments of being? We hope the reader
will be under no alarm from such a beginning, or entertain
any fear of being treated to a dish of indigestible
metaphysics. The terms we have placed at
the head of our Editor's Table, as suggestive of appropriate
thoughts for the closing month of the year,
are, indeed, the deepest in philosophy. In all ages
have they been the watchwords of the schools. Aristotle
failed in the attempt to measure them. Kant
acknowledged his inability to fathom the profundity
of their significance. And yet there are none, perhaps,
that enter more into the musings of that common
philosophy which is for all minds, for all ages,
and for all conditions in life. Who has not thought
on the enigma of time and space, each baffling every
effort the mind may make for its pure and perfect
conception without some aid from the notion of its
inseparable correlative? Where is the man, or child
even, who has not been drawn to some contemplation
of that wondrous stream on whose bosom we are
sailing, but of which we can conceive neither origin
nor outlet; that mysterious river ever sweeping us
along as by some irresistible <i>outward</i> force, and yet
seeming to be so strangely affected by the internal
condition of each soul that is voyaging upon its current&mdash;at
one time the scenery upon its banks gliding
by with a placid swiftness that arrests the attention
even of the least reflective&mdash;at another, the mind
recalled from a reverie which has seemingly carried
us onward many a league from the last remembered
observation of our mental longitude, but only to discover,
with surprise, that the objects on either shore
have hardly receded a perceptible distance in the perspective
of our spiritual panorama. We have passed
the equinoctial line, and are under fair sail for the enchanted
kingdom of Candaya, when, like Don Quixotte
and Sancho on the smooth-flowing Ebro, we start
up to find the rocks and trees, and all the familiar
features of the same old "real world" yet full in sight,
and that we have scarcely drifted a stone's throw from
the point of our departure. It is astonishing to what a
distance the mental wanderings may extend in the
briefest periods. The idea was never better expressed
than by a pious old deacon, who used most feelingly
to lament this sin of wandering thoughts in the midst
of holy services. Between the first and fourth lines
of a hymn, he would say, the soul may rove to the
very ends of the earth. The fixed outward measure
arresting the attention by its marked commencement
and its closing cadence, presented the extent of such
subjective excursions in their most startling light.
Childhood, too, furnishes vivid illustrations of the
same psychological phenomena&mdash;childhood, that musing
introspective period, which, on some accounts,
may be regarded as the most metaphysical portion of
human life. Who has not some reminiscences of this
kind belonging to his boyish existence? How in health
the morning has seemed to burst upon him in apparent
simultaneousness with the moment when his
head first dropped upon the pillow, and he has wondered
to think how mysteriously he had leaped the
interval which unerring outward indications had compelled
him to assign to the measured continuity of
his existence! How has he, on the other hand, in
sickness, marked the unvaried ticking of the clock
through the long dark night, and fancied that the
slow-pacing hours would never flee away. His one
sense and thought of pain, had arrested the current
of his being, and even the outer world seemed to
stand still, as though in sympathy with the suspended
movement of his own inner life. In experiences
such as these, the mind of the child has been brought
directly upon the deepest problem in psychology.
He has been on the shore of the great mystery, and
Kant, and Fichte, and Coleridge could go no farther,
except, it may be, to show how utterly unfathomable
for our present faculties, the mystery is. Philosophy
comes back ever to the same unexplained position.
She can not conceive of mind as existing out of time
and space, and she can not well conceive of time
and space as wholly separate from the idea of successive
thought, or, in other words, a perceiving and
measuring mind.</p>

<p>Such phenomena present themselves in our most
ordinary existence. Let a man be in the habit of
tracing back his roving thoughts, until he connects
them with the last remembered link from which the
wandering reverie commenced, and he will be amazed
to find how long a time may in a few moments have
passed through the mind. The minute hand has
barely changed its position, and not only images and
thoughts, but hopes, and fears, and moral states have
been called out, which, under other circumstances,
might have occupied an outward period extending it
in almost any assignable ratio. Indeed it is impossible
to assign any limit here. As far as our moral
life is measured by actual spiritual exercise, a man
may sin as much in a minute as, at another time, in
a day. He may have had, in the same brief interval,
a heaven of love and joy, which, in a different inward
condition of the spirit, months and years would
hardly have sufficed to realize.</p>

<p>Such cases are familiar to all reflective minds.
Even as they take place in ordinary health, they may
well produce the conviction, that there are mysteries
enough for our study in our most common experience,
without resorting to mesmerism or spiritual rappings.
It is, however, in sickness, that such phenomena assume
their most startling aspect, and furnish subjects
of the most serious thought. The apparent decay of
the mind in connection with that of the body&mdash;the
apparent injuries the one sustains from the maladies
of the other, have furnished arguments for the infidel,
and painful doubts for the unwilling skeptic. But
there is another aspect to facts of this kind. They
sometimes show themselves in a way which must be
more startling to the materialist than to the believer.
They furnish evidence that the present body, instead
of being essential to the spirit's highest exercises, is
only its temporary regulator, intended for a period to
<i>limit</i> its powers, by keeping them in enchained harmony
with that outer world of nature in which the
human spirit is to receive its first intellectual and
moral training. If it does not originate the <i>law</i> of
successive thought, it governs and measures its <i>movement</i>.
Through the dark closet to which it confines
the soul, images and ideas are made to pass, one by
one, in orderly march; and while the body is in
health, and does not sleep, and holds steady intercourse
with the world around us, it performs this restraining
and regulative office with some good degree
of uniformity. Viewed merely in reference to its
own inner machinery, the clock may have any kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
or degree of movement. It may perform the apparent
revolutions of days and years, in seconds and fragments
of seconds. But attach to it a pendulum of a
proper length, and its rates are immediately adjusted
to the steady course of external nature. The new
regulative power is determined by the mass and gravity
of the earth. It is what the diurnal rotation
causes it to be. The latter, again, is linked with the
annual revolution, and this, again, with some far-off
millennial, or millio-millennial, cycle of the sun, and
so on, until the little time-piece on our Editor's Table,
is in harmony with the <i>magnus annus</i>, the great cosmical
year, the <i>one</i> all-embracing time of the universe.
The regulative action of the body upon the soul, although
far less uniform, presents a fair analogy. In
ordinary health, the measured flow of thought and
feeling will bear some relation to the circulation of
the blood, the course of respiration, and those general
cycles of the body, or human <i>micro-cosmos</i>,
which have acquired and preserved a steady rate of
movement. It is true that there are times, even in
health, when the thoughts burst from this regulative
control, imparting their own impetus to the nervous
fluid, giving a hurried agitation to the quick-panting
breath, and sending the blood in maddened velocity
through the heart and veins. But it is in sickness
that such a breaking away from the ordinary check
becomes most striking. The pendulum removed, or
the spring broken, how rapidly spin round the whizzing
wheels by which objective time is measured.
And so of our spiritual state. In that harmony between
the inward and the outward, in which health
consists, we are insensible to the presence of the regulative
power. In the slightest sicknesses we feel
the dragging chain, and time moves slow, and sometimes
almost stops. It is in this crisis of severe disease
that a deeper change takes place. Some link
is snapped; and then how inconceivably rapid may
be, and sometimes is, the course of thought. Now
the long-buried past comes up, and moves before us,
not in slow succession, but in that swift array which
would seem to place it altogether upon the canvas.
At other times, the soul goes out into a self-created
future; a dream it may be called, but having, as far
as the spirit is concerned, no less of authentic moral
and intellectual interest on that account. Suppose
even the whole physical world to be all a dream.
What then? No article of moral truth would be in
the least changed; joy and suffering, right and wrong,
would be no less real. Might they not be regarded
as even the more tremendously real, from the very
fact that they would be, in that case, the only realities
in the universe? Nothing here is really gained
by any play upon that most indefinable of all terms&mdash;reality.
If that is <i>real</i> which most deeply affects us,
and enters most intimately into our conscious being,
then in a most <i>real</i> sense may it be affirmed, that
years sometimes pass in the crisis of a fever, and that
a life-time&mdash;an intellectual and a moral life-time&mdash;may
be lived in what, to spectators, may have seemed
to have been but a moment of syncope, or of returning
sensibility to outward things. Such facts should
startle us. They give us a glimpse of those fearful
energies which even now the spirit possesses, and
which may exhibit themselves with a thousand-fold
more power, when all the balance-wheels and regulating
pendulums shall have been taken off, and the
soul left to develop that higher law of its being which
now remains, in a great degree, suspended and inert,
like the chemist's latent heat and light.</p>

<p>In illustration of such a view, we might refer to
recorded facts having every mark of authenticity.
They come to as from all ages. There is the strange
story which Plutarch gives us of the trance of Thespesius,
and of the immense series of wonders he witnessed
during the short period of apparent death.
Strikingly similar to this is that remarkable account
of Rev. William Tennent which must be familiar to
most of our readers. Something analogous is reported
of that strange inner life to which we lately
called attention in the account of Rachel Baker. To
the same effect the story, told by Addison, we think,
of the Dervise and his Magic Water, possessed of
such wondrous properties, that the moment between
the plunging and the withdrawing of the head, became,
subjectively, a life-time filled with events of
most absorbing interest. But that may be called an
Oriental romance. Another instance we would relate
from our own personal acquaintance with the
one who was himself the subject of a similar supercorporeal
and supersensual action of the spirit. He
was a man bearing a high reputation for piety and
integrity. It was at the close of a day devoted to
sacred services of an unusually solemn kind that he
related to us what, in the familiar language of certain
denominations of Christians, might be called his religious
experience. It was, indeed, of no ordinary
nature, and there was one part, especially, which
made no ordinary impression on our memory. We
can only, in the most rapid manner, touch upon the
main facts, as they bear upon the thoughts we have
been presenting. In the crisis of a violent typhus
fever, during a period which could not have occupied,
at the utmost, more than half an hour, a subjective
life was lived, extending not merely to hours and
days, but through long years of varied and most
thrilling experience. He had traveled to foreign
lands, and encountered every species of adventure.
He had amassed wealth and lost it. He had formed
new social bonds with their natural accompaniments
of joy and grief. He had committed crimes and suffered
for them. He had been in exile, cast out, and
homeless. He had been in battle and in shipwreck.
He had been sick and recovered. And, finally, he
had died, and gone to judgment, and received the
condemnation of the lost. Ages had passed in outer
darkness, during all which the exercises of the soul
were as active, and as distinct, and as coherently
arranged, as at any period of his existence. At length
a fairly perceptible beam of light, coming seemingly
from an immense distance, steals faintly into his
prison-house. Nearer, and nearer still, it comes,
although years and years are occupied with its slow,
yet steady approach. But it does increase. Fuller,
and clearer, and higher, grows the light of hope, until
all around him, and above him, is filled with the benign
glory of its presence. He dares once more look
upward, and as he does so, he beholds beaming upon
him the countenance of his watching friend, bending
over him with the announcement that the crisis is
past, and that coolness is once more returning to his
burning frame. Only a prolonged dream, it might
perhaps be said. But dreams in general run parallel
with the movement of outward time, or if they do go
beyond it, it is never by any such enormously magnified
excess. But besides the apparent length of
such a trance, there was also this striking and essential
difference. Dreams may be more or less vivid;
but all possess this common character, that in the
waking state we immediately recognize them as
dreams; and this not merely by way of inference
from our changed condition, but because, in themselves,
they possess that unmistakably subjective, or
dream-like aspect, we can never separate from their
outward contemplation. They almost immediately
put on the dress of dreams. The air of reality, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
fresh on our first awakening, begins straightway to
gather a shade about it. As they grow dimmer and
dimmer, the very effort at recalling only drives them
farther off, and renders them more indistinct, just as
certain optical delusions ever melt away from the
gaze that is directed most steadily toward them.
Thus the phantoms of our sleep dissolve rapidly
"into thin air." As we strive to hold fast their
features in the memory, they vanish farther and
farther from the view, until we can just discern their
pale, ghostly forms receding, in the distance, through
the "gate of horn" into the land of irrecoverable
oblivion. This characteristic of ordinary dreaming
has ever furnished the ground of a favorite comparison
both in sacred and classical poetry&mdash;"Like a
vision of the night"&mdash;"As a dream when one awaketh"&mdash;"Like
a morning dream"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Tenuesque recessit in auras&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Par levibus ventis, volucrique simillima somno.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But these visions of the trance, are, in this respect,
of a different, as well as deeper, nature. The subject
of our narrative most solemnly averred that the
scenes and feelings of this strange experience were
ever after not only real in appearance, but the most
vividly real of any part of his remembered existence.
They never passed away into the place and form of
dreams. He knew they were subjective, but only
from outward testimony, and for some time even this
was hardly sufficient to prevent the deep impression
exhibiting itself in his speech and intercourse with
the world to which he had returned. To his deeper
consciousness they ever seemed realities, ever to
form a part of his most veritable being. Our common
dreams are more closely connected with the
outer world, and the nearest sphere of sensation.
They are generally suggested by obscurely felt bodily
impressions. They belong to a state semi-conscious
of the presence of things around us. But the
others come from a deeper source. They are not</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such stuff as dreams are made of&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But belong to the more interior workings of the spirit,
when disease has released it, either wholly or partially,
from the restrictive outward influence. Still,
whatever may be our theory of explanation, the
thought we would set forth remains equally impressive.
Such facts as these show the amazing power
of the soul in respect to time. They teach us that in
respect to our spiritual, as well as our material organization,
we are indeed "most fearfully and wonderfully
made." They startle us with the supposition
that, in another state of existence, time may be mainly,
if not wholly what the spiritual action causes it
to appear. We have heard of well-attested cases, in
which the whole past, even to its most minute events,
has flashed before the soul, in the dying moments, or
during some brief period of imminent danger arousing
the spirit to a preternatural energy. If there be
truth in such experiences, then no former exercise
or emotion of the soul is ever lost. They belong to
us still, just as much as our present thought, or our
present sensation, and at some period may start up
again to sleep no more, causing us actually to realize
that conception of Boethius which now appears only
a scholastic subtlety&mdash;<i>a whole life ever in one</i>, carrying
with it a consciousness of its whole abiding presence
in every moment of its existence&mdash;<i>tota simul et
interminabilis vit&aelig; possessio</i>. But we may give the
thought a more plain and practical turn. Even now,
it may be said, what we have lived forms still a part
of our being. However it may stand in respect to
outward time, <i>it is never past to us</i>. We are too
much in the habit of regarding ourselves only in reference
to what may <i>seem</i> our present moral state.
We need the corrective power of the idea that we
<span class="smcap">are</span>, not simply what we may now <i>appear</i> to be, but
all we ever have been, and that such we must forever
<span class="smcap">be</span>, unless in the psychology and theology of a
higher dispensation there is some mode of separating
us from our former selves. Now the soul is broken
and dispersed. Then will it come together, and as
in the poetic imagination of the resurrection of the
body, bone meets its fellow-bone, and dust hastens
to join once more in living organization with its
kindred dust, so in the soul's <i>anastasis</i> will all the
lost and scattered thoughts come home again to their
spiritual abode, and from the chaos of the past will
stand forth forever one fixed and changeless being,
the discordant and deformed result of a false and
evil life, or a glorious organization in harmony with
all that is fair and good in the universe.</p>

<hr />

<p>Geology has created difficulties in the interpretation
of certain parts of the Scriptures; but these
are more than balanced by a most important aid,
which in another respect, it is rendering to the cause
of faith. The former are fast giving way before that
sound interpretation of the primeval record which
was maintained by some of the most learned and
pious in the Church, centuries before the new science
was ever dreamed of. The latter is gathering
strength from every fresh discovery. We refer to
the proof geology is furnishing of the late origin of
the human race, and of the absolute necessity of
ascribing it to a supernatural cause. While there
has been an ascending scale of orders, every new
order has commenced with the most mature specimens.
The subsequent history has been ever one
of degeneracy, until a higher power came to the aid
of exhausted nature, and made another step of real
progress in the supernatural organization of a superior
type. The largest fishes, the most powerful
reptiles, were first in the periods of their respective
families. And thus it went on until the introduction
of the human species. An attenuating series of
physical and hyper-physical powers forms the only
theory which, on the fair Baconian induction, will
account for the phenomena presented. There are
scientific as well as theological bigots, and both are
equally puzzled to explain the facts on either set of
principles to the exclusion of the other. It is chiefly,
however, in regard to man that the argument acquires
its great importance; as bearing directly on that first
article, and fundamental support of all faith&mdash;the veritable
existence of the supernatural. This is not the
same with faith in the Scriptures, and yet is most
intimately connected with it. With the utter rejection
of the latter, must soon go all available belief in
a personal deity or a personal future state; and so,
on the contrary, whatever in science shuts up the
soul to a clear belief in the supernatural, even in its
most remote aspect, is so much gained, ultimately,
for the cause of the written oracles. And this is
just what geology is now doing. She proves, beyond
doubt, the late introduction of man upon the
earth, and thus compels us to admit the most supernatural
of all known events within a period comparatively
very near to our own. The fact that, after a
very few thousand years, the light of history is
quenched in total darkness, presenting no farther
trace of man or human things, goes far to prove his
prior non-existence. But it might, perhaps, be maintained,
that of former generations, only the merest
fragments had, from time to time, survived the wreck
of physical convulsions, in which all outward memoranda
of their older existence had wholly perished.
Such memorials, it is true, might have departed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the surface, but then geology must have found them.
She has dug up abundant remains of types and orders,
which, from their position in the strata, she is
compelled to assign to a period anterior to that of
man. There would have been no lack of zeal on the
part of some of her votaries. More than once, on the
supposed discovery of some old bone in a wrong
place (to which it had been carried by some ordinary
disturbance of the deposits), have they rejoiced thereat,
"like one who findeth great spoil." But the evidence
is now beyond all impeachment. Remains of
every other type have been discovered. The relative
periods of their different deposits have been ascertained.
No stone, we may literally say it, has
been left unturned; and yet, not a single joint or
splinter of a human bone has been found to reward
the search. The argument from this is of immense
importance. The essence of all skepticism will be
found, on analysis, to consist in a secret distrust of
the very existence of any thing supernatural&mdash;a latent
doubt whether, after all, every thing may not be nature,
and nature every thing. <i>Unnatural</i> as it may
seem, there are those who actually take delight in
such a view. It hides from the consciousness a secret,
yet real antipathy to the thought of a personal
God, and the moral power of such an idea. Whatever
disturbs this feeling excites alarm, lest all the
foundations of unbelief (if we may use the word of
a thing which has no foundations) should be rendered
insecure by the bare possibility of such <i>direct</i> interference.
Hence the moral power of well attested
miracles, although it has been denied, even by religious
writers, that there is any such moral power. It
is the felt presence of a near personal Deity. It is
the startling thought of the Great <i>Life</i> of the universe
coming very nigh to us, and revealing the latent
skepticism of men's souls. Although greatly transcending,
it is like the effect produced by those operations
of nature that startle us by their instantaneous
exhibition of resistless power, and which no
amount of science can prevent our regarding with
reverence, or religious awe. With all our knowledge
of physical laws, no man, we venture to say it, is
wholly an atheist, or even a consistent naturalist,
when the earth is heaving, or the lightning bolts are
striking thick and fast around him.</p>

<p>Be it, then, near or remote, one unanswerable evidence
of supernatural intervention gives a foundation
for all faith. And this geology does. Only a few
centuries back, on any chronology&mdash;a mere yesterday
we may say&mdash;she brings us face to face with the
most stupendous of personal, miraculous interventions.
No mediate stages&mdash;no transitional developments
have been, or can be discovered&mdash;no links of
half human, half beastly monsters, such as the old
Epicureans loved to imagine, and some modern savans
would have been glad to find. Nothing of this
kind, but all at once, after ages of fishes, and reptiles,
and every kind of lower animation, "a new thing
upon the earth"&mdash;the wondrous human body united
to that surpassingly wondrous entity, the human soul,
and both new born, in all their maturity, from a previous
state of non-existence. So the rocks tell us;
and the rocks, we are assured, on good scientific
authority, "can not deceive us" like the "poetical
myths of man's unreasoning infancy."</p>

<p>Now what difficulties are there for faith after this?
What is there in any of the earlier narrations of the
Bible that should stumble us&mdash;such as the account
of the flood, or the burning of Sodom, or the transactions
at Sinai? The supernatural once established,
and in such an astounding way as this, what
more natural than that the new created race should
receive their earliest moral nurture directly from the
source of their so recent existence? What more
credible than such an early intercourse as the Bible
reveals&mdash;when God walked with men, and spake to
them from his supernatural abode, and angels came
and went on messages of reproof or mercy. How
<i>irrational</i> the skepticism, which, when compelled to
admit the one will still stumble at the other, as being
in itself, and aside from outward testimony, too marvelous
for belief. There are those who are yet disposed
to assail with desperation the doctrine of man's
late supernatural origin. But the danger from that
source is past. Geology and the Scriptures speak the
same language here. There is no need of any forced
exegesis to bring them into harmony. It is only of
yesterday that the Eternal Deity has been upon the
earth. His footsteps are more recent than many of
those natural changes science has taken such pains
to trace. Geology has proved, beyond all doubt, the
fact of man's <i>creation</i>; what then is there hard for
faith in the revealed facts of his <i>redemption</i>? Is the
supernatural origin of a soul an event more easy to
be believed than a series of supernatural interventions
for its deliverance from moral evil, and its exaltation
to a destiny worthy of its heavenly origin?</p>

<p>Next to the winter weather, which is just now
beguiling the town ladies to as pretty a show of
velvets and of martens, as the importers could desire&mdash;talk
is centering upon that redoubtable hero, <span class="smcap">Louis
Kossuth</span>. We are an impulsive people, and take
off our hats, one moment, with a hearty good-will and
devotion; and thrust them over our ears, the next,
with the most dogged contempt; and it would not be
strange, therefore, if we sometimes made mistakes in
our practice of civilities. We fell, naturally enough,
into a momentary counter current&mdash;started by anonymous
and ill-natured letter writers from the other
side of the sea&mdash;in regard to <span class="smcap">Kossuth</span>. While he
was riding the very topmost wave of popular admiration,
a rumor that he had been uncivil and unduly
exacting in his intercourse with the officers of
the Mississippi frigate, struck his gallant craft and
threatened to whelm her under the sea she was so
triumphantly riding. The opportune arrival of the
Mississippi, and the unanimous testimony of her officers
to the respectful and altogether proper demeanor
of the Hungarian hero, restored him to favor and even
swelled the tide which sweeps him to a higher point
of popularity than any other foreigner, <span class="smcap">La Fayette</span>
excepted, has ever reached in our republican country.
How he has earned their respect, a biographical
sketch in another part of our Magazine will enable
each reader to judge for himself.</p>

<p>Linked to <span class="smcap">Kossuth</span> is the new talk about the new
and strange action of that gone-by hero <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span>.
Curiosity-mongers can not but be gratified
at such spectacle of a Republic as France just now
presents; where a man is not only afraid to express
his opinions, but is afraid to entertain them! It must
be a gratifying scene for such old hankerers after the
lusts of Despotism, and the energy of Emperors, as
<span class="smcap">Metternich</span>, to see the loving fraternity of our
sister Republic, called France, running over into
such heart-felt action of benevolence and liberality
as characterize the diplomacy of <span class="smcap">Faucher</span>!</p>

<p>Stout <span class="smcap">Emile de Girardin</span>, working away at his
giant <i>Presse</i>, with the same indomitable courage, and
the same incongruity of impulse, which belonged to
his battle for <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span>, now raises the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
cry of a <i>Working-man</i> for President! And his reasoning
is worth quoting; for it offers an honest,
though sad picture of the heart of political France.
"The choice lies," says he, "between <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span>
and another. <span class="smcap">Louis Napoleon</span> has the eclat
of his name to work upon the ignorant millions of
country voters: unless that <i>other</i> shall have similar
eclat, there is no hope. No name in France can
start a cry, even now, like the name of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>.
Therefore," says <span class="smcap">Girardin</span>, "abandon the name of
a man, and take the name of a <i>class</i>. Choose your
workingman, no matter who, and let the rally be&mdash;'The
Laborer, or the Prince!'"</p>

<p>There is not a little good sense in this, viewed as
a matter of political strategy; but as a promise of
national weal, it is fearfully vain. Heaven help our
good estate of the Union, when we must resort to
such chicanery, to guard our seat of honor, and to
secure the guaranty of our Freedom!</p>

<hr />

<p>The cool air&mdash;nothing else&mdash;has quickened our
pen-stroke to a side-dash at political action: we will
loiter back now, in our old, gossiping way, to the
pleasant current of the dinner chat.</p>

<p>The winter-music has its share of regard; and between
Biscaccianti&mdash;whose American birth does not
seem to lend any patriotic fervor to her triumphs&mdash;and
the new Opera, conversation is again set off with
its rounding Italian expletives, and our ladies&mdash;very
many of them&mdash;show proof of their enthusiasm, by
their bouquets, and their <i>bravos</i>. It would seem that
we are becoming, with all our practical cast, almost
as music-loving a people as the finest of foreign <i>dillettanti</i>:
we defy a stranger to work his way easily
and deftly into the habit of our salon talk, without
meeting with such surfeit of musical <i>critique</i>, as he
would hardly find at any <i>soir&eacute;e</i> of the Chaus&eacute;e d'Antin,
or of Grosvenor Place. There is bruited just
now, with fresh force, the old design of music for
the million; and an opera house with five thousand
seats, will be&mdash;if carried into effect&mdash;a wonder to
ourselves, and to the world.</p>

<hr />

<p>As our pen runs just now to music, it may be
worth while to sketch&mdash;from Parisian chronicle&mdash;an
interview of the famous composer <span class="smcap">Rossini</span>,
with the great musical purveyor of the old world&mdash;Mr.
<span class="smcap">Lumley</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rossini</span>, it is well known, has lately lived in a
quiet and indolent seclusion; and however much he
may enjoy his honors, has felt little disposition to
renew them. The English Director, anxious to secure
some crowning triumph for his winter campaign,
and knowing well that a new composition of
the great Italian would be a novelty sure of success,
determined to try, at the cost of an Italian voyage,
a personal interview.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rossini</span> lives at Bologna&mdash;a gloomy old town,
under the thrall and shadow of the modern Gallic
papacy. He inhabits an obscure house, in a dark
and narrow street. Mr. Lumley rings his bell, and
is informed by the <i>padrona</i> that the great master has
just finished his siesta, and will perhaps see him.
He enters his little parlor unannounced. It is comfortably
furnished&mdash;as comfort is counted in the flea-swarming
houses of Italy; the furniture is rich and
old; the piano is covered with dust. The old master
of sweet sounds is seated in a high-backed chair,
with a gray cat upon his knees, and another cat dextrously
poising on his lank shoulder, playing with
the tassel of his velvet cap.</p>

<p>He rises to meet the stranger with an air of <i>ennui</i>,
and a look of annoyance, that seems to say, "Please
sir, your face is strange, and your business is unknown."</p>

<p>"My name is Lumley," says the imperturbable
Director.</p>

<p>"Lumley&mdash;Lumley," says the master, "I do not
know the name."</p>

<p>It is a hard thing for the most enterprising musical
director of Europe to believe that he is utterly unknown
to the first composer of Southern Europe.</p>

<p>"You should be an Englishman," continues the
host. "Yet the English are good fellows, though
something indiscreet. They are capital sailors, for
example; and good fishermen. Pray, do you fish,
monsieur? If your visit looks that way, you are
welcome."</p>

<p>"Precisely," says the smiling Director; "I bring
you a new style of bait, which will be, I am sure,
quite to your fancy." And with this he unrolls his
"fly-book," and lays upon the table bank-bills to the
amount of one hundred thousand francs. He knows
the master's reputed avarice, and watches his eye
gloating on the treasure as he goes on. "I am, may
it please you, Director of the Opera at London and at
Paris. I wish a new opera three months from now.
I offer you these notes as advance premium for its
completion. Will you accept the terms, and gratify
Europe?"</p>

<p>The old man's eye dwelt on the notes: he ceased
fondling the gray cat. "A hundred thousand francs
in bank-notes," said he, speaking to himself.</p>

<p>"You prefer gold, perhaps," said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"You accept, then?"</p>

<p>The old man's brow grew flushed. A thought of
indignity crossed his mind. "There is then a dearth
of composers, that you come to trouble an old man's
peace?"</p>

<p>"Not at all: the world is full of them&mdash;gaining
honors every season," and the wily Director talked
in a phrase to stir the old master's pride; and again
the brow grew flushed, as a thought of the electric
notes came over him, that had flashed through Europe
and the world, and made his name immortal.</p>

<p>The Director waited hopefully.</p>

<p>But the paroxysm of pride went by; "I <i>can not</i>:"
said the old man, plaintively. "My life is done;
my brain is dry!"</p>

<p>And the Director left him, with his tasseled cap
lying against the high chair back and the gray cat
playing upon his knee.</p>

<p>In English papers, the ending of the Great Exhibition
has not yet ceased to give point to paragraphs.
Observers say that the despoiling of the palace of its
wonders, reduces sadly the effect of the building;
and it is to be feared that the reaction may lead to
its entire demolition. Every country represented is
finding some ground for self-gratulation in its peculiar
awards; and the opinion is universal, that they
have been honestly and fairly made. For ourselves,
whatever our later boasts may be, it is quite certain
that on the score of <i>taste</i>, we made a bad show in
the palace. It was in bad taste to claim more room
than we could fill; it was in bad taste, to decorate our
comparatively small show, with insignia and lettering
so glaring and pretentious; it was in bad taste,
not to wear a little more of that modesty, which conscious
strength ought certainly to give.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, now that the occasion is
over, we may congratulate ourselves on having made
signal triumphs in just <i>those Arts which most distinguish
civilized man from the savage</i>; and in having
lost honor only <i>in those Arts, which most distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
a luxurious nation from the hardy energy of practical
workers.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>It is an odd indication of national characteristic,
that a little episode of love rarely finds a narrator in
either English or American journalism; whereas,
nothing is more common than to find the most habile
of French <i>feuilletonists</i> turning their pen to a deft
exposition of some little garret story of affection;
which, if it be only well told, is sure to have the
range of all the journals in France.</p>

<p>Our eye just now falls upon something of the sort,
with the taking caption of "Love and Devotion;"
and in order to give our seventy odd thousand readers
an idea of the graceful way in which such French
story is told, we shall render the half-story into English:</p>

<p>In 1848, a young girl of high family, who had
been reared in luxury, and who had previously lost
her mother, found herself in a single day fatherless
and penniless. The friends to whom she would have
naturally looked for protection and consolation, were
either ruined or away. Nothing remained but personal
effort to secure a livelihood.</p>

<p>She rented a small garret-room, and sought to secure
such comforts as she required by embroidering.
But employers were few and suspicious. Want and
care wore upon her feeble frame, and she fell sick.
With none to watch over or provide for her, she
would soon have passed off (as thousands do in that
gay world) to a quick and a lonely death.</p>

<p>But there happened to be living in the same pile
of building, and upon the same landing, a young
Piedmontese street-porter, who had seen often, with
admiring eyes, the frail and beautiful figure of his
neighbor. He devised a plan for her support, and
for proper attendance. He professed to be the agent
of some third party of wealth, who furnished the
means regularly for whatever she might require. His
earnings were small; but by dint of early and hard
working, he succeeded in furnishing all that her necessities
required.</p>

<p>After some weeks, Mlle. <span class="smcap">Sophie</span> (such is the name
our paragraphist gives the heroine) recovered; and
was, of course, anxious to learn from the poor Piedmontese
the name of her benefactor. The poor fellow,
however, was true to the trust of his own devotion,
and told nothing. Times grew better, and
<span class="smcap">Sophie</span> had a hope of interesting the old friends of
her family. She had no acquaintance to employ as
mediator but the poor Piedmontese. He accepted
readily the task, and, armed with her authority, he
plead so modestly, and yet so earnestly for the unfortunate
girl, that she recovered again her position,
and with it no small portion of her lost estate.</p>

<p>Again she endeavored to find the name of her generous
benefactor, but no promises could wrest the
secret from the faithful Giacomo. At least, thought
the grateful <span class="smcap">Sophie</span>, the messenger of his bounties
shall not go unrewarded; and she inclosed a large
sum to her neighbor of the garret.</p>

<p>Poor Giacomo was overcome!&mdash;the sight of the
money, and of the delicate note of thanks, opened
his eyes to the wide difference of estate that lay between
him and the adored object of his long devotion.
To gain her heart was impossible; to live without
it, was even more impossible. He determined&mdash;in
the Paris way&mdash;to put an end to his cankerous hope,
and to his life&mdash;together.</p>

<p>Upon a ledge of the deserted chamber he found a
vial of medicine, which his own hard-earned money
had purchased, and with this he determined to slip
away from the world, and from his grief.</p>

<p>He penned a letter, in his rude way, full of his
love, and of his desolation, and having left it where it
would reach <span class="smcap">Sophie</span>, when all should be over, he
swallowed the poison. Happily&mdash;(French story is
always happy in these interventions)&mdash;a friend had
need of his services shortly after! and hearing sad
groans at his door, he burst it open, and finding the
dangerous state of the Piedmontese, ran for a physician.
Prompt effort brought <span class="smcap">Giacomo</span> to life again.
But his story had been told; and before this, the gay
<span class="smcap">Sophie</span> had grown sad over the history of his griefs.</p>

<p>We should like well to finish up our tale of devotions,
with mention of the graceful recognition of the
love of the infatuated Piedmontese, by the blooming
Mademoiselle <span class="smcap">Sophie</span>. But, alas! truth&mdash;as represented
by the ingenious Journalist&mdash;forbids such sequel.
And we can only write, in view of the vain
devotion of the Sardinian lover&mdash;<i>le pauvre Giacomo!</i></p>

<hr />

<p>Yet again, these graceful columns of French newsmakers,
lend us an episode&mdash;of quite another sort of
devotion. The other showed that the persuasion of
love is often vain; and this will show, that the persuasion
of a wife is&mdash;vainer still.</p>

<p>&mdash;A grave magistrate of France&mdash;no matter who&mdash;was
voyaging through Belgium with his wife. They
had spun out a month of summer with that graceful
mingling of idlesse and wonder, that a Frenchwoman
can so well graft upon the habit of a husband's
travel: they had bidden adieu to Brussels, and to
Liege, and were fast nearing the border-town, beyond
which lay their own sunny realm of France.</p>

<p>The wife suddenly cuts short her smiles, and whispers
her husband&mdash;"<i>Mon cher</i>, I have been guilty of
an imprudence."</p>

<p>"It is not possible."</p>

<p>"<i>Si</i>: a great one. I have my satchel full of laces,
they are contraband; pray, take them and hide them
until the frontier is past."</p>

<p>The husband was thunderstruck: "But, my dear,
I&mdash;a magistrate, conceal contraband goods?"</p>

<p>"Pray, consider, <i>mon cher</i>, they are worth fifteen
hundred francs; there is not a moment to lose."</p>

<p>"But, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;in your hat&mdash;the whistle is sounding&mdash;"</p>

<p>There seemed no alternative, and the poor man
bestowed the contraband laces in his <i>chapeau</i>.</p>

<p>The officials at the frontier, on recognizing the dignity
of the traveler, abstained from any examination
of his luggage, and offered him every facility. Thus
far his good fortune was unexpected. But some unlucky
attendant had communicated to the town authorities
the presence of so distinguished a personage.
The town authorities were zealous to show
respect; and posted at once to the station to make
token of their regard. The magistrate was charmed
with such attention&mdash;so unexpected, and so heart-felt.
He could not refrain from the most gracious
expression of his <i>reconnaissance</i>; he tenders them his
thanks in set terms;&mdash;he bids them adieu;&mdash;and, in
final acknowledgment of their kindness&mdash;he lifts his
hat, with enthusiastic flourish.</p>

<p>&mdash;A shower of Mechlin lace covers the poor man,
like a bridal vail!</p>

<p>The French Government winks at the vices, and
short-comings of representatives and President; but
with a humble magistrate, the matter is different.
The poor man, <i>bon-gr&egrave;</i>&mdash;<i>mal-gr&egrave;</i>, was stopped upon
the frontier&mdash;was shorn of his bridal covering; and
in company with his desponding wife, still (so <span class="smcap">Guinot</span>
says) pays the forfeit of his yielding disposition,
in a dusky, and grated chamber of the old border
town of &mdash;&mdash;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<h2>Editor's Drawer.</h2>


<p>Well, "<i>Election is over</i>," for one thing, and we
breathe again. The freemen of the "Empire
State" have walked up to the polls, the "captain's
office" of the boat on which we are all embarked, and
"settled" the whole matter. The little slips of paper
have done the deed, without revolution and without
bloodshed. Some are rejoiced, because they have
succeeded; others lament that when they were all
ready at any moment to die for their country and a
fat office, their offers were not accepted by the sovereigns.
Some, with not much character to spare
of their own, are grieved to find that "tailing-on"
upon individual eminence won't always "do" with
the people. And, by-the-by, speaking of "tailing-on,"
there "hangs a tale," which is worth recording.
It may be old, but we heard it for the first time the
other evening, and it made us "laugh consumedly."
This it is:&mdash;At the time of the first election of General
<span class="smcap">Washington</span> to the Presidency, there was a party
in one of the Southern States, called the "<i>John Jones'
Party</i>." The said Jones, after whom the party took
its name, was a man of talent; a plotting, shrewd
fellow, with a good deal of a kind of "Yankee cunning;"
in short, possessing all the requisites of a
successful politician, except personal popularity.
To overcome this latter deficiency, of which he was
well aware, especially in a contest with a popular
candidate for Congress, John Jones early avowed
himself as the peculiar and devoted friend of General
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, and on this safe ground, as he
thought, he endeavored to place his rival in opposition.
In order to carry out this object more effectually,
he called a meeting of his county, of "All those
friendly to the election of General <span class="smcap">George Washington</span>!"</p>

<p>On the day appointed, Mr. John Jones appeared,
and was, on the cut-and-dried motion of a friendly
adherent, made chairman of the meeting. He opened
the proceedings by a high and carefully-studied eulogium
upon the life and services of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>,
but taking care only to speak of himself as his early
patron, and most devoted friend. He concluded his
remarks by a proposition to form a party, to be called
"<i>The True and Only Sons of the Father of his Country</i>:"
and for that object, he submitted to the meeting
a resolution something like the following:</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That we are the friends of General
<span class="smcap">George Washington</span>, and will sustain him in the
coming election against all other competitors."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Mr. Jones, after reading the
resolution, "the Chair is now about to put the question.
The chairman hopes that every man will
declare his sentiments, either for or against the
resolution. All those in favor of the resolution will
please to say 'Ay.'"</p>

<p>A thundering "<i>Ay</i>!" shook the very walls of the
building. The united voices were like the "sound
of many waters."</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, for the opposition," said John
Jones. "All those who are contrary-minded, will
please to say '<i>No</i>!'"</p>

<p>Not a solitary voice was heard. The dead silence
seemed to confuse Mr. Jones very much. After some
hesitation and fidgeting, he said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, <i>do vote</i>. The Chair can not decide a
disputed question when nobody votes on the other
side. We want a direct vote, so that the country
may know who are the real and true friends of General
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>."</p>

<p>Upon this appeal, one of the audience arose, and
said:</p>

<p>"I perceive the unpleasant dilemma in which the
Chair is placed; and in order to relieve the presiding
officer from his quandary, I now propose to amend
the resolution, by adding, after the name of General
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>&mdash;'<i>and John Jones for Congress</i>.'"</p>

<p>"The amendment is in order&mdash;I accept the amendment,"
said the chairman, speaking very quickly;
"and the Chair will now put the question as amended:</p>

<p>"All those who are in favor of General <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
for President, and John Jones for Congress, will
please to say, 'Ay.'"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;ay!" said John Jones and his brother, with
loud voices, which they had supposed would be
drowned in the unanimous thunder of the affirmative
vote.</p>

<p>The "Chair" squirmed and hesitated. "Put the
contrary!" said a hundred voices, at the same moment:</p>

<p>"All those op&mdash;po&mdash;po&mdash;sed," said the Chair, "will
please to say, 'No!'"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o!!" thundered every voice but two
in the whole assembly, and these were Jones' and
his brother's. Then followed a roar of laughter, as
<span class="smcap">Carlyle</span> says, "like the neighing of all Tattersall's."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Mr. Jones, "the Chair perceives
that there are people in this meeting who
don't belong to <i>our</i> party: they have evidently come
here to agitate, and make mischief. I, therefore, do
now adjourn this meeting!"</p>

<p>Whereupon, he left the chair; and amid shouts
and huzzahs for <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, and groans for John
Jones, he "departed the premises."</p>

<hr />

<p>We find in the "Drawer" a rich specimen of logic-chopping,
at which there was a hearty laugh more
years ago than we care to remember. It is an admirable
satire upon half the labored criticisms of
Shakspeare with which the world has been deluged:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined!"<br /></span>
<span class="i12"><span class="smcap">Macbeth</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I never was more puzzled in my life than in deciding
upon the right reading of this passage. The
important inquiry is, Did the hedge-pig <i>whine once</i>, or
<i>thrice and once</i>? Without stopping to inquire whether
hedge-pigs exist in Scotland, that is, pigs with quills
in their backs, the great question occurs, <i>how many
times did he whine</i>? It appears from the text that the
cat mewed three times. Now would not a virtuous
emulation induce the hedge-pig to endeavor to get the
last word in the controversy; and how was this to be
obtained, save by whining thrice <i>and</i> once? The
most learned commentators upon <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> have
given the passage thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice; and once the hedge-pig whined."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thereby awarding the palm to the brinded cat. The
fact is, they probably entertained reasonable doubts
whether the hedge-pig was a native of Scotland, and
a sense of national pride induced them to lean on the
side of the productions of their country. I think a
heedful examination of the two lines, will satisfy
the unbiased examiner that the hedge-pig whined, at
least, four times. It becomes me, however, as a candid
critic, to say, that reasonable doubts exist in both
cases!"</p>

<hr />

<p>Doesn't the impressive inquiry embodied in the
ensuing touching lines, somewhat enter into the matrimonial
thoughts of <i>some</i> of our city "offerers?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>There is something very touching and pathetic
in a circumstance mentioned to us a night or two
ago, in the sick-room of a friend. A poor little girl,
a cripple, and deformed from her birth, was seized
with a disorder which threatened to remove her from
a world where she had suffered so much. She was
a very affectionate child, and no word of complaining
had ever passed her lips. Sometimes the tears would
come in her eyes, when she saw, in the presence of
children more physically blessed than herself, the
severity of her deprivation, but that was all. She
was so gentle, so considerate of giving pain, and so
desirous to please all around her, that she had endeared
herself to every member of her family, and to
all who knew her.</p>

<p>At length it was seen, so rapid had been the progress
of her disease, that she could not long survive.
She grew worse and worse, until one night, in an interval
of pain, she called her mother to her bed-side,
and said, "Mother, I am dying now. I hope I shall
see you, and my brother and sisters in Heaven.
Won't I be <i>straight</i>, and not a cripple, mother, when
I <i>do</i> get to Heaven?" And so the poor little sorrowing
child passed forever away.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I heard something a moment ago," writes a correspondent
in a Southern city, "which I will give
you the skeleton of. It made me laugh not a little;
for it struck me, that it disclosed a transfer of 'Yankee
Tricks' to the other side of the Atlantic. It would
appear, that a traveler stopped at Brussels, in a post-chaise,
and being a little sharp-set, he was anxious
to buy a piece of cherry-pie, before his vehicle should
set out; but he was afraid to leave the public conveyance,
lest it might drive off and leave <i>him</i>. So,
calling a lad to him from the other side of the street,
he gave him a piece of money, and requested him to
go to a restaurant or confectionery, in the near vicinity,
and purchase the pastry; and then, to 'make assurance
doubly sure,' he gave him <i>another</i> piece of money,
and told him to buy some for himself at the same time.
The lad went off on a run, and in a little while came
back, eating a piece of pie, and looking very complacent
and happy. Walking up to the window of
the post-chaise, he said, with the most perfect <i>nonchalance</i>,
returning at the same time one of the pieces
of money which had been given him by the gentleman,
'The restaurateur had only <i>one</i> piece of pie left,
and that <i>I</i> bought with my money, that you gave
me!'"</p>

<p>This anecdote, which we are assured is strictly
true, is not unlike one, equally authentic, which had
its origin in an Eastern city. A mechanic, who had
sent a bill for some article to a not very conscientious
pay-master in the neighborhood, finding no returns,
at length "gave it up as a bad job." A lucky thought,
however, struck him one day, as he sat in the door
of his shop, and saw a debt-collector going by, who
was notorious for sticking to a delinquent until <i>some</i>
result was obtained. The creditor called the collector
in, told him the circumstances, handed him the account,
and added:</p>

<p>"Now, if you will collect that debt, I'll give you
half of it; or, if you don't collect but <i>half</i> of the bill,
I'll divide <i>that</i> with you."</p>

<p>The collector took the bill, and said, "I guess, I
can get half of it, <i>any</i> how. At any rate, if I don't,
it shan't be for want of <i>trying</i> hard enough."</p>

<p>Nothing more was seen of the collector for some
five or six months; until one day the creditor thought
he saw "the indefatigable" trying to avoid him by
turning suddenly down a by-street of the town.
"Halloo! Mr. &mdash;&mdash;!" said he; "how about that bill
against Mr. Slowpay? Have you collected it yet?"
"Not the <i>hull</i> on it, I hain't," said the imperturbable
collector; "but I c'lected <i>my</i> half within four weeks
a'ter you gin' me the account, and he hain't paid me
nothin' since. I tell him, every time I see him, that
you want the money <i>very</i> bad; but he don't seem to
mind it a bit. He is dreadful 'slow pay,' as you said,
when you give me the bill! Good-morning!" And
off went the collector, "staying no further question!"</p>

<p>There is a comical blending of the "sentimental"
and the "matter-of-fact" in the ensuing lines, which

new coat:</p>

<p>"My name," said a tall, good-looking man, with a
decidedly <i>distingu&eacute;</i> air, as he entered the office of a
daily newspaper in a sister city, "my name, Sir, is
<span class="smcap">Page</span>&mdash;Ed-w-a-rd Pos-th-el-wa-ite <span class="smcap">Pa-ge</span>! You
have heard of me no doubt. In fact, Sir, I was sent
to you, by Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;r, of the '&mdash;&mdash; Gazette.' I
spent some time with him&mdash;an hour perhaps&mdash;conversing
with him. But as I was about explaining
to him a little problem which I had had in my mind
for some time, I <i>thought</i> I saw that he was busy, and
couldn't hear me. In fact, he <i>said</i>, 'I wish you would
do me the kindness to go <i>now</i> and come <i>again</i>; and
always send up your <i>name</i>, so that I may know that
it is <i>you</i>; otherwise,' said he, 'I <i>shouldn't</i> know that
it was <i>you</i>, and might <i>refuse</i> you without knowing it.'
Now, Sir, that was kind&mdash;that was kind, and gentlemanly,
and I shall remember it. Then he told me
to come to see <i>you</i>; he said yours was an afternoon
paper, and that <i>your</i> paper for to-day was out, while
he was engaged in getting his ready for the morning.
He rose, Sir, and saw me to the door; and downstairs;

<p>Yes, reader; this was <span class="smcap">Page</span>, the Monomaniac: a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
man perfectly sound on any subject, and capable of
conversing upon any topic, intelligently and rationally,
until it so happened, in the course of conversation,
that he <i>mentioned any numerical figure</i>, when his
wild imagination was off at a tangent, and he became
suddenly as "mad as a March hare" on <i>one subject</i>.
<i>Here</i> his monomania was complete. In every thing
else, there was no incoherency; nothing in his
speech or manner that any gentleman might not
either say or do. So much for the man: now for a
condensed exhibition of his peculiar idiosyncrasy, as
exhibited in a paper which he published, devoted to
an elaborate illustration of the great extent to which
he carried the science of mathematics. The <i>fragments</i>
of various knowledge, like the tumbling objects
in a kaleidoscope, are so jumbled together, that we
defy any philosopher, astronomer, or mathematician,
to read it without roaring with laughter; for the feeling
of the ridiculous will overcome the sensations of
sympathy and pity. But listen: "Here's '<i>wisdom</i>' for
you," as Captain Cuttle would say: <i>intense</i> wisdom:</p>

<p>Now it is about enough to make one crazy to read

<p>"If you regard, Mr. Editor, the following," says
a city friend, "as worthy a place in your 'Drawer,'
you are perfectly welcome to it. It was an actual occurrence,
and its authenticity is beyond a question:</p>

<p>"Many years ago, when sloops were substituted
for steamboats on the Hudson River, a celebrated
Divine was on his way to hold forth to the inhabitants
of a certain village, not many miles from New
York. One of his fellow-passengers who was an
unsophisticated countryman, to make himself appear
'large' in the eyes of the passengers, entered into a
conversation with the learned Doctor of Divinity.
After several ordinary remarks, and introducing himself
as one of the congregation, to whom he (the
doctor) would expound the Word on the morrow,
the following conversation took place:</p>

<p>"'Wal, Doctor, I reckon you know the Scripters
pooty good,' remarked the countryman.</p>

<p>"'Really, my friend,' said the clergyman, 'I leave
that for <i>other</i> persons to determine. You know it
does not become a person of any delicacy to utter
praise in his own behalf.'</p>

<p>"'So it doesn't,' replied the querist; 'but I've
heerd folks say, you know rather more than <i>we</i> do.
They say you're pooty good in larning folks the <span class="smcap">Bible</span>:
but I guess I can give you a poser.'</p>

<p>"'I am pleased to answer questions, and feel gratified
to tender information at any time, always considering
it my <i>duty</i> to impart instruction, as far as it
lies in my power,' replied the clergyman.</p>

<p>"'Wall,' says the countryman, with all the imperturbable
gravity in the world, 'I spose you've heerd
tell on, in the Big <span class="smcap">Book</span>, 'bout Aaron and the golden
calf: now, in your opinion, do you think the calf
Aaron worshiped, was a heifer or a bull?'</p>

<p>"The Doctor of Divinity, as may be imagined,
immediately '<i>vamosed</i>,' and left the countryman
bragging to the by-standers, that he had completely
nonplussed the clergyman!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<h2>Literary Notices</h2>


<p>A new work by <span class="smcap">Herman Melville</span>, entitled
<i>Moby Dick; or, The Whale</i>, has just been issued
by Harper and Brothers, which, in point of richness
and variety of incident, originality of conception, and
splendor of description, surpasses any of the former
productions of this highly successful author. <i>Moby
Dick</i> is the name of an old White Whale; half fish
and half devil; the terror of the Nantucket cruisers;
the scourge of distant oceans; leading an invulnerable,
charmed life; the subject of many grim and
ghostly traditions. This huge sea monster has a
conflict with one Captain Ahab; the veteran Nantucket
salt comes off second best; not only loses a
leg in the affray, but receives a twist in the brain;
becomes the victim of a deep, cunning monomania;
believes himself predestined to take a bloody revenge
on his fearful enemy; pursues him with fierce demoniac
energy of purpose; and at last perishes in the
dreadful fight, just as he deems that he has reached
the goal of his frantic passion. On this slight framework,
the author has constructed a romance, a tragedy,
and a natural history, not without numerous gratuitous
suggestions on psychology, ethics, and theology.
Beneath the whole story, the subtle, imaginative
reader may perhaps find a pregnant allegory, intended
to illustrate the mystery of human life. Certain it
is that the rapid, pointed hints which are often thrown
out, with the keenness and velocity of a harpoon,
penetrate deep into the heart of things, showing that
the genius of the author for moral analysis is scarcely
surpassed by his wizard power of description.</p>

<p>In the course of the narrative the habits of the
whale are fully and ably described. Frequent graphic
and instructive sketches of the fishery, of sea-life
in a whaling vessel, and of the manners and customs
of strange nations are interspersed with excellent
artistic effect among the thrilling scenes of the
story. The various processes of procuring oil are
explained with the minute, painstaking fidelity of a
statistical record, contrasting strangely with the
weird, phantom-like character of the plot, and of
some of the leading personages, who present a no
less unearthly appearance than the witches in Macbeth.
These sudden and decided transitions form a
striking feature of the volume. Difficult of management,
in the highest degree, they are wrought with
consummate skill. To a less gifted author, they
would inevitably have proved fatal. He has not only
deftly avoided their dangers, but made them an element
of great power. They constantly pique the attention
of the reader, keeping curiosity alive, and
presenting the combined charm of surprise and alternation.</p>

<p>The introductory chapters of the volume, containing
sketches of life in the great marts of Whalingdom,
New Bedford and Nantucket, are pervaded with
a fine vein of comic humor, and reveal a succession of
portraitures, in which the lineaments of nature shine
forth, through a good deal of perverse, intentional
exaggeration. To many readers, these will prove
the most interesting portions of the work. Nothing
can be better than the description of the owners of
the vessel, Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad, whose
acquaintance we make before the commencement of
the voyage. The character of Captain Ahab also
opens upon us with wonderful power. He exercises
a wild, bewildering fascination by his dark and mysterious
nature, which is not at all diminished when
we obtain a clearer insight into his strange history.
Indeed, all the members of the ship's company, the
three mates, Starbuck, Stubbs, and Flash, the wild,
savage Gayheader, the case-hardened old blacksmith,
to say nothing of the pearl of a New Zealand harpooner,
the bosom friend of the narrator&mdash;all stand
before us in the strongest individual relief, presenting
a unique picture gallery, which every artist must
despair of rivaling.</p>

<p>The plot becomes more intense and tragic, as it
approaches toward the denouement. The malicious
old Moby Dick, after long cruisings in pursuit of him,
is at length discovered. He comes up to the battle,
like an army with banners. He seems inspired with
the same fierce, inveterate cunning with which Captain
Ahab has followed the traces of his mortal foe. The
fight is described in letters of blood. It is easy to
foresee which will be the victor in such a contest.
We need not say that the ill-omened ship is broken
in fragments by the wrath of the weltering fiend.
Captain Ahab becomes the prey of his intended victim.
The crew perish. One alone escapes to tell
the tale. Moby Dick disappears unscathed, and for
aught we know, is the same "delicate monster,"
whose power in destroying another ship is just announced
from Panama.</p>

<p>G. P. Putnam announces the <i>Home Cyclopedia</i>, a
series of works in the various branches of knowledge,
including history, literature, and the fine arts, biography,
geography, science, and the useful arts, to be
comprised in six large duodecimos. Of this series
have recently appeared <i>The Hand-book of Literature
and the Fine Arts</i>, edited by <span class="smcap">George Ripley</span> and
<span class="smcap">Bayard Taylor</span>, and <i>The Hand-book of Universal
Biography</i>, by <span class="smcap">Parke Godwin</span>. The plan of the
Encyclopedia is excellent, adapted to the wants of
the American people, and suited to facilitate the acquisition
of knowledge. As a collateral aid in a
methodical course of study, and a work of reference
in the daily reading, which enters so largely into the
habits of our countrymen, it will, no doubt, prove of
great utility.</p>

<p><i>Rural Homes</i>, by <span class="smcap">Gervasse Wheeler</span> (published
by Charles Scribner), is intended to aid persons proposing
to build, in the construction of houses suited
to American country life. The author writes like a
man of sense, culture, and taste. He is evidently
an ardent admirer of John Ruskin, and has caught
something of his &aelig;sthetic spirit. Not that he deals
in mere theories. His book is eminently practical.
He is familiar with the details of his subject, and
sets them forth with great simplicity and directness.
No one about to establish a rural homestead should
neglect consulting its instructive pages.</p>

<p>Ticknor, Reed, and Fields have published a new
work, by <span class="smcap">Nathaniel Hawthorne</span>, for juvenile readers,
entitled <i>A Wonder-Book for Boys and Girls</i>
with engravings by Barker from designs by Billings.
It is founded on various old classical legends, but
they are so ingeniously wrought over and stamped
with the individuality of the author, as to exercise
the effect of original productions. Mr. Hawthorne
never writes more genially and agreeably than when
attempting to amuse children. He seems to find a
welcome relief in their inartificial ways from his
own weird and sombre fancies. Watching their
frisky gambols and odd humors, he half forgets the
saturnine moods from which he draws the materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of his most effective fictions, and becomes himself a
child. A vein of airy gayety runs through the present
volume, revealing a sunny and beautiful side of
the author's nature, and forming a delightful contrast
to the stern, though irresistibly fascinating horrors,
which he wields with such terrific mastery in his recent
productions. Child and man will love this work
equally well. Its character may be compared to the
honey with which the author crowns the miraculous
hoard of Baucis and Philemon. "But oh the honey!
I may just as well let it alone, without trying to describe
how exquisitely it smelt and looked. Its color
was that of the purest and most transparent gold;
and it had the odor of a thousand flowers; but of
such flowers as never grew in an earthly garden,
and to seek which the bees must have flown high
above the clouds. Never was such honey tasted,
seen, or smelt. The perfume floated around the
kitchen, and made it so delightful, that had you
closed your eyes you would instantly have forgotten
the low ceiling and smoky walls, and have fancied
yourself in an arbor with celestial honeysuckles
creeping over it."</p>

<p><i>Glances at Europe</i>, by <span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span> (published
by Dewitt and Davenport), has passed rapidly
to a second edition, being eagerly called for by the
numerous admirers of the author in his capacity as
public journalist. Composed in the excitement of a
hurried European tour, aiming at accuracy of detail
rather than at nicety of language, intended for the
mass of intelligent readers rather than for the denizens
of libraries, these letters make no claim to profound
speculation or to a high degree of literary finish.
They are plain, straight-forward, matter-of-fact
statements of what the writer saw and heard in the
course of his travels, recording at night the impressions
made in the day, without reference to the opinions
or descriptions of previous travelers. The information
concerning various European countries,
with which they abound, is substantial and instructive;
often connected with topics seldom noticed by
tourists; and conveyed in a fresh and lively style.
With the reputation of the author for acute observation
and forcible expression, this volume is bound to
circulate widely among the people.</p>

<p>Ticknor, Reed, and Fields, have issued a new volume
of <i>Poems</i>, by <span class="smcap">Richard Henry Stoddard</span>, consisting
of a collection of pieces which have been before
published, and several which here make their
appearance for the first time. It will serve to elevate
the already brilliant reputation of the youthful author.
His vocation to poetry is clearly stamped on his productions.
Combining great spontaneity of feeling,
with careful and elaborate composition, he not only
shows a native instinct of verse, but a lofty ideal of
poetry as an art. He has entered the path which will
lead to genuine and lofty fame. The success of his
early effusions has not elated him with a vain conceit
of his own genius. Hence, we look for still more
admirable productions than any contained in the present
volume. He is evidently destined to grow, and
we have full faith in the fulfillment of his destiny.
His fancy is rich in images of gorgeous and delicate
beauty; a deep vein of reflection underlies his boldest
excursions; and on themes of tender and pathetic
interest, his words murmur with a plaintive melody
that reaches the hidden source of tears. His style,
no doubt, betrays the influence of frequent communings
with his favorite poets. He is eminently susceptible
and receptive. He does not wander in the
spicy groves of poetical enchantment, without bearing
away sweet odors. But this is no impeachment of
his own individuality. He is not only drawn by the
subtle affinities of genius to the study of the best
models, but all the impressions which he receives,
take a new form from his own plastic nature. The
longest poem in the volume is entitled, "The Castle
in the Air"&mdash;a production of rare magnificence.
"The Hymn to Flora," is full of exquisite beauties,
showing a masterly skill in the poetical application
of classical legends. "Harley River," "The Blacksmith's
Shop," "The Old Elm," are sweet rural pictures,
soft and glowing as a June meadow in sunset.
"The Household Dirge," and several of the "Songs
and Sonnets," are marked by a depth of tenderness
which is too earnest for any language but that of the
most severe simplicity.</p>

<p>We have a translation of <span class="smcap">Neander</span> <i>on the Philippians</i>,
by Mrs. <span class="smcap">H. C. Conant</span>, which renders that
admirable practical commentary into sound and vigorous
English. A difficult task accomplished with
uncommon skill. (Published by Lewis Colby).</p>

<p><i>The Heavenly Recognition</i>, by Rev. <span class="smcap">H. Harbaugh</span>,
is the title of an interesting religious work on the
question, "Shall we know our friends in Heaven?"
This is treated by the author with great copiousness
of detail, and in a spirit of profound reverence and
sincere Christian faith. His book will be welcome
to all readers who delight in speculations on the mysteries
of the unseen world. Relying mainly on the
testimony of Scripture, the author seeks for evidence
on the subject in a variety of collateral sources, which
he sets forth in a tone of strong and delightful confidence.
(Published by Lindsay and Blackiston).</p>

<p>Lindsay and Blackiston have issued several richly
ornamented gift books, which will prove attractive
during the season of festivity and friendship. Among
them are, "<i>The Star of Bethlehem</i>," by Rev. <span class="smcap">H. Hastings
Weld</span>, a collection of Christmas stories, with
elegant engravings. "<i>The Woodbine</i>," edited by
<span class="smcap">Caroline May</span>, containing original pieces and selections,
among the latter, "several racy stories of
Old England," and a tempting series of <i>Tales</i> for <i>Boys</i>
and <i>Girls</i>, by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hughes</span>, a justly celebrated
writer of juvenile works.</p>

<p>Bishop <span class="smcap">McIlvaine's</span> <i>Charge</i> on the subject of
<i>Spiritual Regeneration</i> has been issued in a neat
pamphlet by Harper and Brothers. It forms an able
and appropriate contribution to doctrinal theology, at
a time when the topic discussed has gained a peculiar
interest from the present position of Catholicism both
in England and America. The theme is handled by
Bishop McIlvaine with his accustomed vigor and
earnestness, and is illustrated by the fruits of extensive
research.</p>

<p>Speaking of the decease of our illustrious countryman,
<span class="smcap">Fenimore Cooper</span>, the <i>London Athen&aelig;um</i> has
the following discriminating remarks: "Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>
was at home on the sea or in his own backwoods.
His happiest tales are those of 'painted chiefs with
pointed spears'&mdash;to use a happy description of Mr.
Longfellow; and so felicitous has he been in setting
them bodily, as it were, before the reader, that hereafter
he will be referred to by ethnological and antiquarian
writers as historical authority on the character
and condition of the Lost Tribes of America. In
his later works Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span> wandered too often and
too much from the field of Romance into that of Polemics&mdash;and
into the latter he imported a querulous
spirit, and an extraordinarily loose logical method.
All his more recent fictions have the taint of this
temper, and the drawback of this controversial weakness.
His political creed it would be very difficult
to extract entire from the body of his writings; and
he has been so singularly infelicitous in its partial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
expositions, that even of the discordant features
which make up the whole, we generally find ourselves
disagreeing in some measure with all. But
throughout the whole course of his writing, whenever
he turned back into his own domain of narrative fiction,
the Genius of his youth continued to do him
service, and something of his old power over the
minds of readers continued to the last. His faults
as a writer are far outbalanced by his great qualities&mdash;and
altogether, he is the most original writer that
America has yet produced&mdash;and one of whom she
may well be proud."</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hawthorne</span>," says a London critic, "has few
equals among the writers of fiction in the English
language. There is a freshness, an originality of
thought, a quiet humor, a power of description, a
quaintness of expression in his tales, which recommend
them to readers wearied of the dull commonplaces
of all but a select few of the English novelists
of our own time. He is beyond measure the best
writer of fiction yet produced by America, somewhat
resembling <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> in many of his excellencies,
yet without imitating him. His style is his own
entirely."</p>

<p>In a notice of <span class="smcap">Hitchcock's</span> "Religion of Geology,"
the London <i>Literary Gazette</i> remarks: "Dr.
<span class="smcap">Hitchcock</span> is a veteran American clergyman, of
high reputation and unaffected piety. Officially, he
is President of Amherst College, and Professor of
Natural Theology and Geology in that institution.
As a geologist, he holds a very distinguished position,
and is universally reputed an original observer and
philosophical inquirer. His fame is European as
well as American. No author has ever entered upon
his subject better fitted for his task. The work consists
of a series of lectures, which may be characterized
as so many scientific sermons. They are clear
in style, logical in argument, always earnest, and
often eloquent. The author of the valuable and most
interesting work before us combines in an eminent
degree the qualifications of theologian and geologist."</p>

<hr />

<p>The <i>London News</i> briefly hits off an American
work which has attracted little attention in this
country: "A fast-sailing American clipper has appeared
in the seas of philosophy. The author of
'Vestiges of Civilization; or the Etiology of History,
Religious, &AElig;sthetical, Political, and Philosophical,'
advertised as written within two months, has puzzled
the scientific public as much as did the original
MS. of 'Pepys' Diary.' The reader, however, may
be comforted in his bewilderment by finding that the
author himself is but little better off. In a note there
is a confession which should certainly have been extended
to the whole production: "I freely own that,
touching these extreme terms of the complication in
Life and Mind, or rather the precise combinations
of polarities that should produce them, <i>my meaning
is at present very far from clear, even to myself</i>. And
yet I know that I <i>have</i> a meaning; that it is logically
involved in my statement; and is such as (perhaps
within half a century) will set the name of some distinct
enunciator side by side with, if not superior to
that of Newton."</p>

<p>The <i>Westminster Review</i> has passed into the hands
of John Chapman, the well-known publisher of works
on Rationalistic theology. <i>The Leader</i> rather na&iuml;vely

the fear, not unfrequently expressed, of his
making the Review over theological, which would
be its ruin."</p>

<p>When the celebrated astronomer Lalande died,
nearly fifty years ago, his manuscripts were divided

of re-collecting these papers, has, after much
trouble, succeeded in getting together the astronomical
memoranda of his ancestor to the extent of not
less than thirty-six volumes. These he presented to
M. Arago; and the latter, to obviate the chances of
a future similar dispersion, has made a gift of them
to the library of the Paris Observatory.</p>

<p>In announcing the "Memoirs of his own Life,"
by <span class="smcap">Alexandre Dumas</span>, the correspondent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<i>Literary Gazette</i> indulges in a lively, exaggerated
portraiture of the great <i>feuilletonist</i>: "Another addition
to that class of French literature, called 'Memoirs,'
is about to appear, and from the hand of no
less a personage than Alexandre Dumas. The great
romancer is to tell the world the history of his own
eventful life, and his extraordinary literary career.
The chances are that the work will be one of the
most brilliant of the kind that has yet been published&mdash;and
that is saying a great deal, when we call to
mind the immense host of memoir writers which
France possesses, and that among them are an Antony
Hamilton and a Duke de Saint Simon. Having
mixed familiarly with all descriptions of society, from
that of crowned heads and princes of the blood, down
to strolling players&mdash;having been behind the scenes of
the political, the literary, the theatrical, the artistic,
the financial, and the trading worlds&mdash;having risen
unaided from the humble position of subordinate clerk
in the office of Louis Philippe's accountant, to that
of the most popular of living romancers in all Europe&mdash;having
found an immense fortune in his inkstand,
and squandered it like a genius (or a fool)&mdash;having
rioted in more than princely luxury, and been reduced
to the sore strait of wondering where he could
get credit for a dinner&mdash;having wandered far and
wide, taking life as it came&mdash;now dining with a king,
anon sleeping with a brigand&mdash;one day killing lions
in the Sahara, and the next (according to his own
account) being devoured by a bear in the Pyrenees&mdash;having
edited a daily newspaper and managed a
theatre, and failed in both&mdash;having built a magnificent
chateau, and had it sold by auction&mdash;having commanded
in the National Guard, and done fierce battle
with bailiffs and duns&mdash;having been decorated by
almost every potentate in Europe, so that the breast
of his coat is more variegated with ribbons than the
rainbow with colors&mdash;having published more than
any man living, and perhaps as much as any man
dead&mdash;having fought duels innumerable&mdash;and having
been more quizzed, and caricatured, and lampooned,
and satirized, and abused, and slandered, and admired,
and envied, than any human being now alive&mdash;Alexandre
must have an immensity to tell, and none of his
contemporaries, we may be sure, could tell it better&mdash;few
so well. Only we may fear that it will be mixed
up with a vast deal of&mdash;imagination. But <i>n'importe</i>!"</p>

<p>The Stockholm papers announce the death, in his

of Sacred Philology at the University of Lund. He
has left to the University of Upsal his library, consisting
of upward of 34,000 volumes&mdash;and his rich
collections of coins and medals, and of Scandinavian
antiquities. This is the fourth library bequeathed to
the University of Upsal within the space of a year&mdash;adding
to its book-shelves no fewer than 115,000

<p>The <i>London Athen&aelig;um</i> announces the death of the
Hon. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>&mdash;sister to the late Lord Byron, and
whose name will ever be dear to the lovers of that
poet's verse for the affecting manner in which it is
therein enshrined. Few readers of Byron will forget
his affectionate recurrences to his sister&mdash;made
more touching from the bitterness of his memories
toward all those whom he accused of contributing to
the desolation of his home and the shattering of his
household gods. The once familiar name met with
in the common obituary of the journals will have
recalled to many a one that burst of grateful tenderness
with which the bard twines a laurel for his sister's
forehead, which will be laid now upon her
grave&mdash;and of which the following is a leaf:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the wreck of the past which hath perished<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This much I at least may recall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That what I most tenderly cherished<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deserved to be dearest of all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the desert a fountain is springing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the wide waste there still is a tree,<br /></span>

<p>Numismatic science has to lament the loss of a
long known, learned, and distinguished cultivator,
Mr. H. P. <span class="smcap">Borrell</span>, who died on the 2d inst. at
Smyrna. His numerous excellent memoirs on Greek
coins, and his clever work on the coins of Cyprus,
form permanent memorials of his erudition, research,

<p>The last mail from China informs us of the death
of Dr. <span class="smcap">Gutzlaff</span>, at one of the British ports in that
country, on the 9th of August last, in his forty-eighth
year. The decease of this distinguished Eastern
scholar will be learnt with regret by those who take
an interest in the progress of European civilization
in China. Dr. Gutzlaff was one of the most ardent
and indefatigable of the laborers in that cause: and
it will be very difficult to fill up the void which his
death has occasioned. He was a Pomeranian by
birth; and was originally sent to Batavia, Singapore,
and Siam by the Netherlands Missionary Society in
1827. He first reached China in 1831; and he appears
to have spent the next two years in visiting
and exploring certain portions of the Chinese coast,
which, previously to that time, had not been visited
by any European&mdash;or of which, at least, no authentic
knowledge was possessed. On the death of the
elder Morrison, in 1834, Dr. Gutzlaff was employed
as an Interpreter by the British Superintendency;
and at a subsequent period he was promoted to the
office of Chinese Secretary to the British Plenipotentiary
and Superintendent of Trade. That employment
he held to the time of his death. Dr.
Gutzlaff had ceased to consider himself as a missionary
for some years past; but he never relinquished his
practice of teaching and exhorting among the Chinese
communities in the midst of whom he was placed.</p>

<p>The death of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Mary Sherwood</span>, the celebrated
English authoress, took place at Twickenham
about the middle of September. She had attained
the ripe old age of seventy-six years, but her mind
preserved its usual vigor and serenity, unimpaired
by the influence of time. She died in the exercise
of a tranquil spirit, and firm religious faith. It is
said that a biography, prepared from materials left by
the deceased, will soon make its appearance from the
pen of her youngest daughter, a lady who inherits a
portion of her mother's genius and character. A complete
edition of Mrs. Sherwood's works, published by
Harper and Brothers, has found numerous readers in
this country, by whom the name of the writer will
long be held in affectionate remembrance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>We perceive, with great
alarm, the increasing number
of abstruse names given to
various simple articles of clothing
and commerce. Rather to
keep a head of the world than
even to run with it, we intend
to register&mdash;or dispose of for a
consideration&mdash;the sole right of
producing the following articles:</p>

<p>The <i>Protean Crononhotontologos</i>,
or Changeable Surtout, the
tails of which button under to
form a dress coat; can be reefed
to make a shooting-coat; folded
into a cut-a-way; or taken away
altogether to turn into a sailing
jacket. It is black outside and
green within, with sets of shifting
buttons, so that it may be
used either for dress or sporting,
evening or morning, with
equal propriety.</p>

<p>The <i>Oddrotistone</i>, or Pumice
Beard-leveler, for shaving without
water, soap, brush, or razor,
and removing all pimples and
freckles by pure mechanical action.
Strongly recommended to
travelers with delicate skins.</p>

<p>The <i>Hicockolorum</i>, or Patent
Fuel, warranted never to smoke,
smell, decrease in bulk, or throw
out dangerous gases, and equally
adapted for Calorific, Church,
Vesta, Air-tight, Registering,
Cooking, and all manner of
stoves. By simply recollecting
never to light it, all these conditions
will be fulfilled, or we
forfeit fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The <i>Antilavetorium</i>, or Perpetual
Shirt-collar, which, being
formed of enameled tin, never
requires to be washed, is not
likely to droop or turn down.</p>

<p>The <i>Thoraxolicon</i>, or Everlasting
Shirt-front, comes under the
same patent, which may be had
also, perforated in patterns, after
the fashionable style.</p>

<p>The <i>Silicobroma</i>, a preparation
of pure flint-stone, which makes
a very excellent soup, by boiling
in a pot, with the requisite quantity
of meat and vegetables.</p>

<p>We have been much grieved of late to observe
the growing tendency among ladies
to <i>shave their foreheads</i>, in the hope of intellectualizing
their countenances, and this occurs
more especially among the literary portion of
the fair sex. We subjoin a portrait, but mention
no names.</p>

<p>The mistake is this. The height of a forehead
depends upon the height of the frontal
bone&mdash;not upon the growth of the hair; and,
therefore, when the forehead retreats, it is absurd
to suppose that height
can be given by shaving the
head, even to the crown.
Added to this, it is impossible
to conceal the blue mark
which the shorn stumps of
hair still <i>will</i> leave; and, therefore,
we hope soon to see the
practice abolished.</p>

</div>

<p>The figure on the left, in the above illustration,
shows a very rich ball costume, with jewels.
Hair in raised bands, forming a point in front, leaving
the forehead open, and spreading elegantly at the
sides. A large cord of pearls is rolled in the hair,
and forms, in two rows, a <i>Marie Stuart</i>, over the
forehead, then mixed with the back hair, falls to the
right and left in interlaced rings. Body low, square
in front, but rather high on the shoulder. The dress
is plain silk, the ornaments silk-net and lace. The
whole of the front of the body is ornamented with
rows of lace and silk-net <i>bouillons</i>. Each row of
lace covers a <i>bouillon</i>, and leaves one uncovered.
There are five or six rows of lace. They are gathered,
and it will be seen they are raised by the row
of puffs they cover. Two rows of lace are put on as
trimming on each side of the stomacher. They start
from the same point, spreading wider as they rise, as
far as the back, where they form a <i>berthe</i>. The skirt
is trimmed with three rows, one over the other, composed
of silk-net puffs; one at bottom, another one-third
of the height up, and the other two-thirds up.
Three lace flounces decorate this skirt, and each
falls on the edge of the puffs.</p>

<p>The figure on the right exhibits a beautiful evening
dress. Hair in puffed bands, waved, rather short,
wreath of variegated geraniums, placed at the sides.
Plain silk dress, with silk-net <i>ruch&eacute;s</i> about three
inches apart, from the bottom upward. Sleeves,
tight and short, edged with a <i>ruch&eacute;</i> at bottom. The
body is covered with silk-net, opening heart-shape.
It is trimmed with two silk-net <i>berthes</i>, gathered a
little, with a hem about half an inch wide, marked
by a small gold cord. A row of variegated flowers
runs along the top of the body. The upper skirt, of
silk-net, is raised cross-wise, from the front toward
the back, up to the side bouquet. The hem of each
skirt is two inches deep, and is also marked by a gold
cord. The side bouquet, of flowers like those in the
hair, is fixed to the body, and hangs in branches on
the skirt. The outer sleeves are silk-net, with a hem
at the end, and raised cross-wise like the skirt, so as
to show the under-sleeves.</p>

<p>In the picture, upon the next page, we give illustrations
of three styles of cloaks, the most fashionable
for the present winter. They are called by the
Parisian modists respectively, <span class="smcap">Parisian</span>, <span class="smcap">Frileuse</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Camara</span>. The <span class="smcap">Parisian</span> is a walking cloak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
satin or <i>gros</i> d'Ecosse, trimmed with velvet of different
widths sewed on flat; velvet buttons. The
<span class="smcap">Frileuse</span> is a wadded pelisse of satin <i>&agrave; la reine</i> or
common. Trimming <i>&agrave; la vieille</i> of the same, with
velvet bands. The pelerine may form a hood. The
sleeves are wide and straight. The <span class="smcap">Camara</span> is a
cloak of plain cloth, forming a <i>Talma</i> behind, and
open cross-wise in front to prevent draping. Wide
flat collar. Ornaments consist of velvet fretwork
with braid round it.</p>

<p>Figure 6 represents an elegant costume for a little
girl, three or four years of age&mdash;a pretty, fair haired
creature. Frock of white silk, embroidered sky blue,
body low and square in front, with two silk lapels,
embroidered and festooned; a frill along the top of
front, with an embroidered insertion below it. The
sleeves are embroidered; a broad blue ribbon passes
between the shoulder and the sleeve, and is fastened
at top by a <i>rosette</i> with loose ends. This manner of
tying the ribbon raises the sleeve and leaves the arm
uncovered at top. The skirt is composed of two insertions
and two embroidered flounces. An embroidered
petticoat reaches below the skirt. The sash
is of blue silk and very wide.</p>

<p>Velvet, as a trimming, was never more fashionable
than at present. There are at this season few articles
included in the category of ladies' costume to which
a trimming of velvet may not be applied. Velvet is
now employed to ornament plain dresses, as well as
those of the most elegant description. One of the
new dresses we have seen, is composed of maroon-color
silk. The skirt has three flounces, each edged
with two rows of black velvet ribbon, of the width of
half an inch. The corsage and sleeves are ornamented
with the same trimming. Another dress, composed of
deep violet or puce-color silk, has the flounces edged
also with rows of black velvet. The majority of the
dresses, made at the present season, have high corsages,
though composed of silk of very rich and thick
texture.</p>

accent on the last syllable. The Magyar equivalent for the
French <span class="smcap">Louis</span> and the German <span class="smcap">Ludwig</span> is <span class="smcap">Lajos</span>. We
have given the date of his birth, which seems best authenticated.
The notice of the Austrian police, quoted below,
makes him to have been born in 1804; still another account
gives 1801 as the year of his birth. The portrait
which we furnish is from a picture taken a little more
than two years since in Hungary, for Messrs. <span class="smcap">Goupil</span>,
the well-known picture-dealers of Paris and New York,
and is undoubtedly an authentic likeness of him at that
time. The following is a pen-and-ink portrait of Kossuth,
drawn by those capital artists, the Police authorities of
Vienna:&mdash;"<i>Louis Kossuth</i>, an ex-advocate, journalist,
Minister of Finance, President of the Committee of Defense,
Governor of the Hungarian Republic, born in Hungary,
Catholic [this is an error, Kossuth is of the Lutheran
faith], married. He is of middle height, strong, thin; the
face oval, complexion pale, the forehead high and open,
hair chestnut, eyes blue, eyebrows dark and very thick,
mouth very small and well-formed, teeth fine, chin round.
He wears a mustache and imperial, and his curled hair
does not entirely cover the upper part of the head. He has
a white and delicate hand, the fingers long. He speaks
German, Hungarian, Latin, Slovack, a little French and
Italian. His bearing when calm, is solemn, full of a certain
dignity; his movements elegant, his voice agreeable,
softly penetrating, and very distinct, even when he speaks
low. He produces, in general, the effect of an enthusiast;
his looks often fixed on the heavens; and the expression
of his eyes, which are fine, contributes to give him the
air of a dreamer. His exterior does not announce the
energy of his character." Photography could hardly produce
a picture more minutely accurate.</p></div>

has been republished in this country; in a different, and
somewhat indifferent translation, in the anonymous
"<i>Louis Kossuth and Hungary</i>," published in London,
written strongly in the Austrian interest. In this latter,
however, the "Address to the Throne," by far the most
important and weighty portion of the speech, is omitted.
A portion of the speech, taken from this latter source,
and of course not embracing the Address, is given in Dr.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
